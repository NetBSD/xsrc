This will attempt to load a .bdf font into wsdisplay, to be used with
wsconsctl -dw font=<name>
Optionally it can:
- produce a header to be used with src/sys/dev/wsfont/
- write a .wsf file to be used with wsfontload
- produce debug output

Command line options:
 -o <file> will write a file instead of trying to feed the font to wsdisplay,
    default format is wsf
 -h to be used with -o, will write a header usable with dev/wsfont/
 -f force bdfload to use a non-monospaced font, which would otherwise be
    rejected. Use with caution, results will look uneven.
 -v be verbose. This will dump various font parameters to the console.
 -d dump glyph shapes to the console, mostly for font debugging
 -e <encoding> override the font's encoding
 -N <name> override the font's name for both file output and wsdisplay
 -2 double the size of a font
 -s smoothe pixel staircases when enlarging

Caveats:
- fonts wider than 16 pixels won't work yet
- some drivers may have trouble with font widths that are not a multiple of 4
- no attempt has been made to make this play nice with vga text mode
