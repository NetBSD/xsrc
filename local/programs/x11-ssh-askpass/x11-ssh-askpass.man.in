.Nd an X11-based pass-phrase dialog for use with OpenSSH
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm @NAME@
.Op options
.Op label
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an X11-based pass-phrase dialog for use with OpenSSH.
It is intended to be called from the
.Xr ssh-add 1
program and not invoked directly.
.Pp
.Nm
supports most standard Toolkit command line arguments, with the
exception of
.Ar -geometry ,
.Ar -borderwidth ,
.Ar -iconic ,
.Ar -rv ,
and
.Ar -title .
See
.Xr X 7 .
.Pp
If exactly one non-option argument is provided on the command line, it
is displayed in the dialog instead of the default label.
If the argument contains newline characters ('\\n'), each line of text
is displayed on a separate line in the dialog.
.Pp
The features of
.Nm
are as follows:
.Bl -dash -offset indent
.It
Configurable via the standard X resource mechanisms
.Pa /usr/X11R7/lib/X11/app-defaults ,
.Pa ~/.Xdefaults ,
.Xr xrdb 1 ,
etc.
.It
Requires only stock X11 libraries (\%libXt, \%libX11, \%libSM, \%libICE).
.It
Can be configured to grab the keyboard and/or pointer (grabs the
keyboard by default, not the pointer).
.El
.Pp
The user interface is somewhat different than most password/pass-phrase
dialogs and more similar to the X11-based pass-phrase dialog that
accompanies the regular SSH distribution.
Instead of a text field that fills with asterisks or some other
character as the user enters the pass-phrase, a series of LED-like
areas light up one-by-one with each pass-phrase character entered,
beginning from the left-hand edge of the dialog.
When they reach the right-hand edge, they go dark one-by-one
again, and so on.
This gives the user feedback that pass-phrase characters have been
entered, but does not provide onlookers with a cue as to the length
of the pass-phrase.
.Pp
Pressing the
.Sq OK
button accepts the pass-phrase (even if it is empty),
which is printed on the standard output, and the dialog exits with a
status of zero (success).
Pressing the
.Sq Cancel
button discards the
pass-phrase, and the dialog exits with non-zero status.
.Pp
The following keystrokes work as expected:
.Bl -tag -width "[Backspace]" -offset indent -compact
.Pp
.It Bq Backspace
.It Bq Delete
Erase previous character
.Pp
.It Bq Control+U
.It Bq Control+X
Erase entire pass-phrase
.Pp
.It Bq Enter
.It Bq Control+M
.It Bq Control+J
Accept pass-phrase (OK)
.Pp
.It Bq Escape
Discard pass-phrase (Cancel)

.Sh RESOURCES
The following resources are used to customize the application
globally:
.Bl -tag -width 2n -offset indent
.It Cm grabKeyboard ( No class Cm GrabKeyboard )
.Bl -inset -compact
.It specifies if the application should grab the keyboard.
.It Default value:
.Dq True .
.El
.It Cm grabPointer ( No class Cm GrabPointer )
.Bl -inset -compact
.It specifies if the application should grab the pointer.
.It Default value:
.Dq False .
.El
.It Cm grabServer ( No class Cm GrabServer )
.Bl -inset -compact
.It specifies if the application should grab the server.
.It Default value:
.Dq False .
.El
.It Cm inputTimeout ( No class Cm InputTimeout )
.Bl -inset -compact
.It the number of seconds
.Nm
should wait for a key or
button press before it gives up and exits.
A timeout of
.Dq 0
means wait forever.
.It Default value:
.Dq 0 .
.El
.It Cm defaultXResolution ( No class Cm DefaultXResolution )
.Bl -inset -compact
.It the number of pixels per unit length that horizontal
spacing and width values are intended for.
If the actual
horizontal (x) resolution of the X server is significantly
greater or less than this value, portions of the dialog,
indicator, and button widgets are stretched or shrunk
horizontally to take the difference into account.
The value is a positive integer, followed by a slash
.Cm ( / )
and a one- or two-character unit abbreviation.
Valid units are inches
.Cm ( in
or
.Cm i )
and meters
.Cm ( m ) .
.It Default value:
.Dq 75/in
(75 pixels per inch).
.El
.It Cm defaultYResolution ( No class Cm DefaultYResolution )
.Bl -inset -compact
.It the number of pixels per unit length that vertical
spacing and height values are intended for.
If the actual
vertical (y) resolution of the X server is significantly
greater or less than this value, portions of the dialog,
indicator, and button widgets are stretched or shrunk
vertically to take the difference into account.
Valid values are the same as for
.Cm defaultXResolution
above.
.It Default value:
.Dq 75/in
(75 pixels per inch).
.El
.It Cm xResolutionFuzz ( No class Cm XResolutionFuzz )
.Bl -inset -compact
.It the range of
.Dq fuzz
around the value of
.Cm defaultXResolution
beyond which some widgets will be stretched or shrunk
horizontally to fit the current actual horizontal
resolution.
Valid values are the same as for
.Cm defaultXResolution .
For example, if the default X resolution is
.Dq 75/in ,
and the X resolution fuzz is
.Dq 50/in ,
then widgets won't be scaled horizontally unless the actual
horizontal resolution is less than 25 pixels per inch or
greater than 125 pixels per inch.
.It Default value:
.Dq 20/in
(20 pixels per inch).
.El
.It Cm yResolutionFuzz ( No class Cm YResolutionFuzz )
.Bl -inset -compact
.It the range of
.Dq fuzz
around the value of
.Cm defaultYResolution
beyond which some widgets will be stretched or shrunk
vertically to fit the current actual vertical
resolution.
Valid values are the same as for
.Cm defaultXResolution
above.
.It Default value:
.Dq 20/in
(20 pixels per inch).
