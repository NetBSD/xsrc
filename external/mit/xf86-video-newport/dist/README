  1.  Supported Hardware

  This is an unaccelerated driver for the SGI newport cards (a.k.a. XL)
  as found in the SGI Indy and Indigo2. Both the 8bit and 24bit versions
  are tested and working.


  2.  Features


  o  Support for 8 and 24 bit pixel depths

  o  Hardware cursor support to reduce flicker


  3.  Notes


  o  X -configure does not generate a xorg.conf file.

  o  There's only a 1280x1024 mode.



  4.  Configuration

  The driver auto-detects all device information necessary to initialize
  the card on the Indy. The only lines you need in the "Device" section
  of your xorg.conf file are:

         Section "Device"
             Identifier "SGI newport"
             Driver     "newport"
         EndSection


  Indigo2 users have to use the BusID option as documented below.

  However, if you have problems with auto-detection, you can specify:

  o  bitplanes - number of physical bitplanes (8 or 24)

  o  HWCursor - enable or disable hardware cursor

  o  BusID - set this to "1" on the Indigo2 XL
