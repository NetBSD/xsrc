<abstract>

<para>
X11R&relvers; is an Open Source version of the X Window System that
supports many <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> and UNIX-like
operating systems (such as Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and Solaris)
on a variety of platforms.  This version is compatible with
X11R&prevrelvers; and other X Window System implementations which support
the X11 standard.

conditions on the modification or redistribution or either source code
or binaries beyond requiring one or more of the following:

X11R&relvers; was the &whichfullrel; release of the modular source code tree.
The source code has been split into nine logical modules: app, data, doc,
driver, font, lib. proto, util and xserver.  Each of these modules
contain one or more packages that can be configured, built and installed
separately.  Please see an X.Org release site for a complete
list of the tarballs.

For information on how to build the modular tree packages see the <ulink

contains information for developers who want to help improve the modular
build system and modular code base.

Before
reporting bugs, please check the server log file, which can be found at

resolve the problem yourself, send the entire log file with your bug report but
not the operating system core dump.  Do not edit the log file as our
developers use it to reproduce and debug your problem.  Please attach it
to your bug report.
