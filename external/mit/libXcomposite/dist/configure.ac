# returns the version from xcompositewire.h, NOT the version we set here.
# But we try to keep these the same.  Note that the library has an extra
# digit in the version number to track changes which don't affect the
# protocol, so Xcomposite version l.n.m corresponds to protocol version l.n
# that 'revision' number appears in Xcomposite.h and has to be manually
# synchronized.
