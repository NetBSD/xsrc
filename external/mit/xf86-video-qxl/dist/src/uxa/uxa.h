	 *   effect when set on pSrcPicture or pDstPicture.
	 * - The source and mask Pictures may have a transformation set
	 *   (Picture->transform != NULL), which means that the source
	 *   coordinates should be transformed by that transformation,
	 *   resulting in scaling, rotation, etc.  The PictureTransformPoint()
	 *   call can transform coordinates for you.  Transforms have no
	 *   effect on Pictures when used as a destination.
	 * - The source and mask pictures may have a filter set.
	 *   PictFilterNearest and PictFilterBilinear are defined in the
	 *   Render protocol, but others may be encountered, and must be
	 *   handled correctly (usually by prepare_composite failing, and
	 *   falling back to software).  Filters have
	 *   no effect on Pictures when used as a destination.
	 * - The source and mask Pictures may have repeating set, which must be
	 *   respected.  Many chipsets will be unable to support repeating on
	 *   pixmaps that have a width or height that is not a power of two.
	 *
	 * If your hardware can't support source pictures (textures) with
	 * non-power-of-two pitches, you should set #UXA_OFFSCREEN_ALIGN_POT.
