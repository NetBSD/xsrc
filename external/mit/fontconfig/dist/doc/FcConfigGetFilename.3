.SH SYNOPSIS

FcChar8 * FcConfigGetFilename (FcConfig *\fIconfig\fB, const FcChar8 *\fIname\fB);
.fi\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Given the specified external entity name, return the associated filename.
This provides applications a way to convert various configuration file
references into filename form.
.PP
A null or empty \fIname\fR indicates that the default configuration file should
be used; which file this references can be overridden with the
FONTCONFIG_FILE environment variable. Next, if the name starts with \fI~\fR, it
refers to a file in the current users home directory. Otherwise if the name
doesn't start with '/', it refers to a file in the default configuration
directory; the built-in default directory can be overridden with the
FONTCONFIG_PATH environment variable.
.PP
The result of this function is affected by the FONTCONFIG_SYSROOT environment variable or equivalent functionality.
