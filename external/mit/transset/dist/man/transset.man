.SH NAME
transset \- Set transparency on a window
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B transset
[\fI-options ...\fP] [\fIopacity\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B transset
is a simple program for X servers supporting the XFIXES, DAMAGE,
and COMPOSITE extensions.  It lets the user set the transparency on a window.
.PP
The \fIopacity\fP value is a number from 0 to 1, with zero being fully
transparent and 1 being fully opaque.
If no \fIopacity\fP argument is given, a default value of 0.75 is used for the
opacity value.  If neither \fB--inc\fP nor \fB--dec\fP are given, the
opacity is treated as an absolute value and set to the given opacity
value.  If \fB--inc\fP or \fB--dec\fP is specified, then the opacity is
treated as a relative value to increase or decrease the current opacity by.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.TP 8
.B -display \fIdisplay\fP
This option specifies the server to use; see \fIX(__miscmansuffix__)\fP.
.PP
.TP 8
.BR -h ", " --help
This option displays a help message and exits.
.PP
.TP 8
.BR -t ", " --toggle
This option forces a toggle of opacity.  If the current opacity is not set
to fully opaque (opacity 1.0), it will be reset to fully opaque.
If the window is already fully opaque, the opacity will be set normally.
.PP
.TP 8
.BR -c ", " --click
This option selects the target window by waiting for the user to click the
mouse - the topmost window under the mouse cursor when the mouse click occurs
will be used as the target.
.PP
.TP 8
.BR -p ", " --point
This option selects the window currently under the cursor to be the target.
.PP
.TP 8
.BR -a ", " --actual
This option selects the window that currently has input focus to be the target.
.PP
.TP 8
.BR -n ", " --name " \fIname\fP"
This option selects the target window by name, where \fIname\fP is matched as
a regular expression, unless \fB--no-regex\fP is also specified.
.PP
.TP 8
.B --no-regex
This option disables treating the \fIname\fP argument to \fB--name\fP as a
regular expression.
.PP
.TP 8
.BR -i ", " --id
This option selects the target window by window id.
.PP
.TP 8
.B --inc
This option increases the window opacity by the given \fIopacity\fP argument.
.PP
.TP 8
.B --dec
This option decreases the window opacity by the given \fIopacity\fP argument.
.PP
.TP 8
.BR -m ", " --min " \fIopacity\fP"
This option sets the minimum possible opacity value.  It defaults to 0 if this
option is not given.
.PP
.TP 8
.BR -x ", " --max " \fIopacity\fP"
This option sets the maximum possible opacity value.  It defaults to 1 if this
option is not given.
.PP
.TP 8
.BR -v ", " --verbose
This option prints some additional debug info as the program operates.
.PP
.TP 8
.BR -V ", " --version
This option prints the program version number and exits.
