xkbevd - XKB event daemon
-------------------------

The xkbevd event daemon listens for specified XKB events and executes
requested commands if they occur.  The configuration file consists of
a list of event specification/action pairs and/or variable definitions.

This command is very raw and is therefore only partially implemented;
we present it here as a rough prototype for developers, not as a general
purpose tool for end users.

All questions regarding this software should be directed at the
Xorg mailing list:
