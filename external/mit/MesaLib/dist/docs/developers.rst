==========

Both professional and volunteer developers contribute to Mesa.

`VMware <https://www.vmware.com/>`__ employs several of the main Mesa
developers including Brian Paul and Keith Whitwell.

In the past, Tungsten Graphics contracts implemented many Mesa features
including:

-  DRI drivers for Intel i965, i945, i915 and other chips
-  Advanced memory manager and framebuffer object support
-  Shading language compiler and OpenGL 2.0 support
-  MiniGLX environment

Other companies including `Intel <https://01.org/linuxgraphics>`__ and
RedHat also actively contribute to the project. Intel has recently
contributed the new GLSL compiler in Mesa 7.9.

`LunarG <https://www.lunarg.com/>`__ can be contacted for custom Mesa /
3D graphics development.

Volunteers have made significant contributions to all parts of Mesa,
including complete device drivers.
