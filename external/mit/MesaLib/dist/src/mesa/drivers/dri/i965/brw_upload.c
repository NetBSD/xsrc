/**
 * Interface for getting memory for uploading streamed data to the GPU
 *
 * In most cases, streamed data (for GPU state structures, for example) is
 * uploaded through brw_state_batch(), since that interface allows relocations
 * from the streamed space returned to other BOs.  However, that interface has
 * the restriction that the amount of space allocated has to be "small".
 *
 * This interface, on the other hand, is able to handle arbitrary sized
 * allocation requests, though it will batch small allocations into the same
 * BO for efficiency and reduced memory footprint.
 *
 * \note The returned pointer is valid only until brw_upload_finish().
 *
 * \param out_bo Pointer to a BO, which must point to a valid BO or NULL on
 * entry, and will have a reference to the new BO containing the state on
 * return.
 *
 * \param out_offset Offset within the buffer object that the data will land.
