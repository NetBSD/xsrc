/* Knockoff u_upload_mgr. Uploads wherever we left off, allocating new entries
 * when needed.
 *
 * In "owned" mode, a single parent owns the entire pool, and the pool owns all
 * created BOs. All BOs are tracked and addable as
 * panfrost_pool_get_bo_handles. Freeing occurs at the level of an entire pool.
 * This is useful for streaming uploads, where the batch owns the pool.
 *
 * In "unowned" mode, the pool is freestanding. It does not track created BOs
 * or hold references. Instead, the consumer must manage the created BOs. This
 * is more flexible, enabling non-transient CSO state or shader code to be
 * packed with conservative lifetime handling.
