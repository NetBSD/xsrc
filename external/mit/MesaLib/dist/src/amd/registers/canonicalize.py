"""
Helper script that was used during the generation of the JSON data.

  usage: python3 canonicalize.py FILE

Reads the register database from FILE, performs canonicalization
(de-duplication of enums and register types, implicitly sorting JSON by name)
and attempts to deduce missing register types.

Notes about deduced register types as well as the output JSON are printed on
stdout.
