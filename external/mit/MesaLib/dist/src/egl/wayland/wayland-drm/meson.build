# linux-dmabuf isn't part of wayland-drm, but this happens to be the only
# place which is a) guaranteed to be built when building either or both
# of EGL and Vulkan WSI, and b) guaranteed to be included before both,
# so the targets are actually defined by the time the files come to be
# used.
#
# Moving these to a src/wsi/ was suggested but shot down, so put these
# here for now as the maybe-least-bad solution.
