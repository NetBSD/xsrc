/** A pass to inline all functions in a shader into their callers
 *
 * For most use-cases, function inlining is a multi-step process.  The general
 * pattern employed by SPIR-V consumers and others is as follows:
 *
 *  1. nir_lower_variable_initializers(shader, nir_var_function_temp)
 *
 *     This is needed because local variables from the callee are simply added
 *     to the locals list for the caller and the information about where the
 *     constant initializer logically happens is lost.  If the callee is
 *     called in a loop, this can cause the variable to go from being
 *     initialized once per loop iteration to being initialized once at the
 *     top of the caller and values to persist from one invocation of the
 *     callee to the next.  The simple solution to this problem is to get rid
 *     of constant initializers before function inlining.
 *
 *  2. nir_lower_returns(shader)
 *
 *     nir_inline_functions assumes that all functions end "naturally" by
 *     execution reaching the end of the function without any return
 *     instructions causing instant jumps to the end.  Thanks to NIR being
 *     structured, we can't represent arbitrary jumps to various points in the
 *     program which is what an early return in the callee would have to turn
 *     into when we inline it into the caller.  Instead, we require returns to
 *     be lowered which lets us just copy+paste the callee directly into the
 *     caller.
 *
 *  3. nir_inline_functions(shader)
 *
 *     This does the actual function inlining and the resulting shader will
 *     contain no call instructions.
 *
 *  4. nir_opt_deref(shader)
 *
 *     Most functions contain pointer parameters where the result of a deref
 *     instruction is passed in as a parameter, loaded via a load_param
 *     intrinsic, and then turned back into a deref via a cast.  Function
 *     inlining will get rid of the load_param but we are still left with a
 *     cast.  Running nir_opt_deref gets rid of the intermediate cast and
 *     results in a whole deref chain again.  This is currently required by a
 *     number of optimizations and lowering passes at least for certain
 *     variable modes.
 *
 *  5. Loop over the functions and delete all but the main entrypoint.
 *
 *     In the Intel Vulkan driver this looks like this:
 *
 *        foreach_list_typed_safe(nir_function, func, node, &nir->functions) {
 *           if (func != entry_point)
 *              exec_node_remove(&func->node);
 *        }
 *        assert(exec_list_length(&nir->functions) == 1);
 *
 *    While nir_inline_functions does get rid of all call instructions, it
 *    doesn't get rid of any functions because it doesn't know what the "root
 *    function" is.  Instead, it's up to the individual driver to know how to
 *    decide on a root function and delete the rest.  With SPIR-V,
 *    spirv_to_nir returns the root function and so we can just use == whereas
 *    with GL, you may have to look for a function named "main".
 *
 *  6. nir_lower_variable_initializers(shader, ~nir_var_function_temp)
 *
 *     Lowering constant initializers on inputs, outputs, global variables,
 *     etc. requires that we know the main entrypoint so that we know where to
 *     initialize them.  Otherwise, we would have to assume that anything
 *     could be a main entrypoint and initialize them at the start of every
 *     function but that would clearly be wrong if any of those functions were
 *     ever called within another function.  Simply requiring a single-
 *     entrypoint function shader is the best way to make it well-defined.
