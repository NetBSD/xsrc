/* Lowing for fragment shader load_output.
 *
 * This pass supports the blend_equation_advanced, where a fragment
 * shader loads the output (fragcolor) to read the current framebuffer.
 * It does this by lowering the output read to a txf_ms_fb instruction.
 * This instruction works similarly to a normal txf_ms except without
 * taking a texture source argument.  (The driver backend is expected
 * to wire this up to a free texture slot which is configured to read
 * from the framebuffer.)
 *
 * This should be run after lower_wpos_ytransform, because the tex
 * coordinates should be the physical fragcoord, not the logical
 * y-flipped coord.
 *
 * Note that this pass explicitly does *not* add a sampler uniform
 * (as txf_ms_fb does not reference a texture).  The driver backend
 * is going to want nif->info.num_textures to include the count of
 * number of textures *not* including the one it inserts to sample
 * from the framebuffer, so it more easily knows where to insert the
 * hidden texture to read from the fb.
