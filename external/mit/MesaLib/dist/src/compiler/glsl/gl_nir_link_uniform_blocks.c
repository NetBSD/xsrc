/**
 * This file contains code to do a nir-based linking for uniform blocks. This
 * includes ubos and ssbos.
 *
 * For the case of ARB_gl_spirv there are some differences compared with GLSL:
 *
 * 1. Linking doesn't use names: GLSL linking use names as core concept. But
 *    on SPIR-V, uniform block name, fields names, and other names are
 *    considered optional debug infor so could not be present. So the linking
 *    should work without it, and it is optional to not handle them at
 *    all. From ARB_gl_spirv spec.
 *
 *    "19. How should the program interface query operations behave for program
 *         objects created from SPIR-V shaders?
 *
 *     DISCUSSION: we previously said we didn't need reflection to work for
 *     SPIR-V shaders (at least for the first version), however we are left
 *     with specifying how it should "not work". The primary issue is that
 *     SPIR-V binaries are not required to have names associated with
 *     variables. They can be associated in debug information, but there is no
 *     requirement for that to be present, and it should not be relied upon.
 *
 *     Options:
 *
 *     <skip>
 *
 *    C) Allow as much as possible to work "naturally". You can query for the
 *    number of active resources, and for details about them. Anything that
 *    doesn't query by name will work as expected. Queries for maximum length
 *    of names return one. Queries for anything "by name" return INVALID_INDEX
 *    (or -1). Querying the name property of a resource returns an empty
 *    string. This may allow many queries to work, but it's not clear how
 *    useful it would be if you can't actually know which specific variable
 *    you are retrieving information on. If everything is specified a-priori
 *    by location/binding/offset/index/component in the shader, this may be
 *    sufficient.
 *
 *    RESOLVED.  Pick (c), but also allow debug names to be returned if an
 *    implementation wants to."
 *
 * When linking SPIR-V shaders this implemention doesn't care for the names,
 * as the main objective is functional, and not support optional debug
 * features.
 *
 * 2. Terminology: this file handles both UBO and SSBO, including both as
 *    "uniform blocks" analogously to what is done in the GLSL (IR) path.
 *
 *    From ARB_gl_spirv spec:
 *      "Mapping of Storage Classes:
 *       <skip>
 *       uniform blockN { ... } ...;  -> Uniform, with Block decoration
 *       <skip>
 *       buffer  blockN { ... } ...;  -> Uniform, with BufferBlock decoration"
 *
 * 3. Explicit data: for the SPIR-V path the code assumes that all structure
 *    members have an Offset decoration, all arrays have an ArrayStride and
 *    all matrices have a MatrixStride, even for nested structures. That way
 *    we don’t have to worry about the different layout modes. This is
 *    explicitly required in the SPIR-V spec:
 *
 *    "Composite objects in the UniformConstant, Uniform, and PushConstant
 *     Storage Classes must be explicitly laid out. The following apply to all
 *     the aggregate and matrix types describing such an object, recursively
 *     through their nested types:
 *
 *    – Each structure-type member must have an Offset Decoration.
 *    – Each array type must have an ArrayStride Decoration.
 *    – Each structure-type member that is a matrix or array-of-matrices must
 *      have be decorated with a MatrixStride Decoration, and one of the
 *      RowMajor or ColMajor Decorations."
 *
 *    Additionally, the structure members are expected to be presented in
 *    increasing offset order:
 *
 *   "a structure has lower-numbered members appearing at smaller offsets than
 *    higher-numbered members"
