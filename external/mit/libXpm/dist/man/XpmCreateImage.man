Specifies the location of the data.
.IP \fIimage_return\fP li
Returns the image which is created.
.IP \fIshapeimage_return\fP li
Returns the shape mask image which is created if the color None is used.

.IP \fIshapeimage\fP li
Specifies the shape mask image which is created if any.

.SH DESCRIPTION

.SS XpmCreateImageFromData
To create an XImage from an XPM data, use XpmCreateImageFromData.

The XpmCreateImageFromData function allows you to include in your C program an XPM file which was
written out by functions such as XpmWriteFileFromImage or XpmWriteFileFromPixmap without reading in the file.
XpmCreateImageFromData exactly works as XpmReadFileToImage() does and returns the same way.
It just reads data instead of a file.
Here again, it is the callerâ€™s responsibility to free the returned images, the colors
and possibly the data returned into the XpmAttributes structure.

.SS XpmCreateImageFromBuffer
To create an XImage from an XPM buffer, use XpmCreateImageFromBuffer.
The XpmCreateImageFromBuffer function works the same way as XpmReadFileToImage(),
it just parses the buffer instead of the file.
Be aware that the feature provided on some systems by XpmReadFileToImage
to deal with compressed files is not available here.

.SS XpmCreateImageFromXpmImage
To create an XImage from an XpmImage, use XpmCreateImageFromXpmImage.
From the given XpmImage and XpmAttributes if not NULL, XpmCreateImageFromXpmImage allocates colors
and creates X images following the same mechanism as XpmReadFileToImage().
When finished the caller must free the images using XDestroyImage,
the colors using XFreeColors, and possibly the
data returned into the XpmAttributes using XpmFreeAttributes().
