.SH DESCRIPTION

.SS XpmCreateImageFromData
.PP
To create an XImage from an XPM data, use
.BR XpmCreateImageFromData ().
.PP
The
.BR XpmCreateImageFromData ()
function allows you to include in your C program an XPM file which was
written out by functions such as
.BR XpmWriteFileFromImage (__libmansuffix__)
or
.BR XpmWriteFileFromPixmap (__libmansuffix__)
without reading in the file.
.BR XpmCreateImageFromData ()
exactly works as
.BR XpmReadFileToImage (__libmansuffix__)
does and returns the same way.
It just reads data instead of a file.
Here again, it is the callerâ€™s responsibility to free the returned images,
the colors and possibly the data returned into the XpmAttributes structure.

.SS XpmCreateImageFromBuffer
.PP
To create an XImage from an XPM buffer, use
.BR XpmCreateImageFromBuffer ().
The
.BR XpmCreateImageFromBuffer()
function works the same way as
.BR XpmReadFileToImage (__libmansuffix__),
it just parses the buffer instead of the file.
Be aware that the feature provided on some systems by
.BR XpmReadFileToImage (__libmansuffix__)
to deal with compressed files is not available here.

.SS XpmCreateImageFromXpmImage
.PP
To create an XImage from an XpmImage, use
.BR XpmCreateImageFromXpmImage ().
From the given XpmImage and XpmAttributes if not NULL,
.BR XpmCreateImageFromXpmImage ()
allocates colors and creates X images following the same mechanism as
.BR XpmReadFileToImage (__libmansuffix__).
When finished the caller must free the images using
.BR XDestroyImage (__libmansuffix__),
the colors using
.BR XFreeColors (__libmansuffix__),
and possibly the data returned into the XpmAttributes using
.BR XpmFreeAttributes (__libmansuffix__).
