.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I xconsole
program displays messages which are usually sent to /dev/console.
.SH OPTIONS
.I Xconsole
accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command line options along with the
additional options listed below:
.TP 8
.B \-file \fIfile-name\fP
To monitor some other device, use this option to specify the device name.
This does not work on regular files as they are always ready to be read from.
.TP 8
.B \-notify \-nonotify
When new data are received from the console and the notify option is set,
the icon name of the application has " *" appended, so that it is evident
even when the application is iconified.  \-notify is the default.
.TP 8
.B \-daemon
This option causes
.I xconsole
to place itself in the background, using fork/exit.
.TP 8
.B \-verbose
When set, this option directs
.I xconsole
to display an informative message in the first line of the text buffer.
.TP 8
.B \-exitOnFail
When set, this option directs
.I xconsole
to exit when it is unable to redirect the console output.
.TP 8
.B \-stripNonprint
When set, this option directs
.I xconsole
to not include any non-printable characters in the current locale in
the displayed output.
.TP 8
.B \-saveLines \fIcount\fP
When set,
.I xconsole
only preserves
.I count
lines of message history instead of growing the text buffer without bound
(a
.I count
of zero \- the default \- is treated as placing no limit on the history).
.TP 8
.B \-help
This option indicates that \fIxconsole\fP should print a usage message and exit.
.TP 8
.B \-version
This option indicates that \fIxconsole\fP should print its version and exit.
.SH X DEFAULTS
This program uses the
.I Athena Text
widget, look in the
.I Athena Widget Set
documentation for controlling it.
.PP
.I Xconsole
otherwise accepts resources of the same names as the command-line options
(without the leading dash).  "file" is a string type, "saveLines" an
integer, and the remaining options are booleans.
.SH WIDGETS
In order to specify resources, it is useful to know the hierarchy of
the widgets which compose \fIxconsole\fR.  In the notation below,
indentation indicates hierarchical structure.  The widget class name
is given first, followed by the widget instance name.
