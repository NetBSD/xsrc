kbd - Keyboard input driver for non-Linux platforms for the Xorg X server
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This keyboard driver is primarily used with BSD, GNU Hurd, illumos, & Solaris
systems.  Linux systems should instead use either xf86-input-libinput or
xf86-input-evdev.

All questions regarding this software should be directed at the
Xorg mailing list:
