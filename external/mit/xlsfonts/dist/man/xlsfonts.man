.SH NAME
xlsfonts \- list fonts available to X server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.ad l
\fBxlsfonts\fR
[\fB\-display \fBhost:dpy\fR\fR] [\fB\-l\fR] [\fB\-ll\fR] [\fB\-lll\fR] [\fB\-m\fR] [\fB\-C\fR] [\fB\-1\fR] [\fB\-w \fBwidth\fR\fR] [\fB\-n \fBcolumns\fR\fR] [\fB\-u\fR] [\fB\-o\fR] [\fB\-fn \fBpattern\fR\fR] [\fB\-v\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
xlsfonts lists the fonts available on an X server that match the given pattern.
The wildcard character "*" may be used to match any sequence of characters
(including none), and "?" to match any single character.
If no pattern is given, "*" is assumed.
.PP
The "*" and "?" characters must be quoted to prevent them from being expanded by the shell.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-display \fIhost:dpy\fB\fR
This option specifies the X server to contact.
.TP
\fB\-d \fIhost:dpy\fB\fR
Same as \fB\-display \fIhost:dpy\fB\fR.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR
Lists some attributes of the font on one line in addition
to its name.
.TP
\fB\-ll\fR
Lists font properties in addition to \fB\-l\fR output.
.TP
\fB\-lll\fR
Lists character metrics in addition to \fB\-ll\fR output.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR
This option indicates that long listings should also print
the minimum and maximum bounds of each font.
.TP
\fB\-C\fR
This option indicates that listings should use multiple columns.
This is the same as \fB\-n 0\fR.
.TP
\fB\-1\fR
This option indicates that listings should use a single column.
This is the same as \fB\-n 1\fR.
.TP
\fB\-w \fIwidth\fB\fR
This option specifies the width in characters that should be
used in figuring out how many columns to print.
The default is 79.
.TP
\fB\-n \fIcolumns\fB\fR
This option specifies the number of columns to use in
displaying the output. By default, it will attempt to
fit as many columns of font names into the number of
character specified by \fB\-w\fR width.
.TP
\fB\-u\fR
This option indicates that the output should be left unsorted.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR
This option indicates that xlsfonts should do an OpenFont
(and QueryFont, if appropriate) rather than a ListFonts.
This is useful if ListFonts or ListFontsWithInfo fail to
list a known font (as is the case with some scaled font
systems).
.TP
\fB\-fn \fIpattern\fB\fR
This option specifies the font name pattern to match.
.TP
.B -v
This option indicates that xlsfonts should print out the program version
and exit.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
\fBDISPLAY\fR
\fBDISPLAY\fR must be set to get the default host and display to use.
.SH BUGS
Doing ``xlsfonts -l'' can tie up your X server for a very long time.
This is really a bug with single-threaded
non-preemptable servers, not with this program.
