The xinit program is used to start the X Window System server and a first
client program on systems that are not using a display manager such as xdm.

The xinit is not intended for naive users.  Instead, site administrators should
design user-friendly scripts that present the desired interface when starting
up X.  The startx script is one such example.

All questions regarding this software should be directed at the
