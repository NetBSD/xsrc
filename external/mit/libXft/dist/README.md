libXft - X FreeType library
---------------------------

libXft is the client side font rendering library, using libfreetype,
libX11, and the X Render extension to display anti-aliased text.

Xft version 2.1 was the first stand alone release of Xft, a library that
connects X applications with the FreeType font rasterization library. Xft
uses fontconfig to locate fonts so it has no configuration files.

Before building Xft you will need to have installed:
 - FreeType                             https://freetype.org/
 - Fontconfig                           https://fontconfig.org/
 - libX11, libXext, & libXrender        https://x.org/

All questions regarding this software should be directed at the
Xorg mailing list:
