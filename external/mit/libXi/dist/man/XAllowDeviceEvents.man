display
       Specifies the connection to the X server\&.

device
       Specifies the device from which events are to be
       allowed\&.
.fi
.sp
.nf
event_mode
       Specifies the event mode\&. You can pass AsyncThisDevice,
       SyncThisDevice, ReplayThisDevice, AsyncOtherDevices,
       SyncAll, or AsyncAll\&.

time
       Specifies the time\&. You can pass either a timestamp or
       CurrentTime\&.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The XAllowDeviceEvents function releases some queued events if the client has caused a device to freeze\&. It has no effect if the specified time is earlier than the last\-grab time of the most recent active grab for the client and device, or if the specified time is later than the current X server time\&.
.sp
The following describes the processing that occurs depending on what constant you pass to the event_mode argument\&.
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
AsyncThisDevice \- If the specified device is frozen by the client, event processing for that device continues as usual\&. If the device is frozen multiple times by the client on behalf of multiple separate grabs, AsyncThisDevice thaws for all\&. AsyncThisDevice has no effect if the specified device is not frozen by the client, but the device need not be grabbed by the client\&.

.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
SyncThisDevice \- If the specified device is frozen and actively grabbed by the client, event processing for that device continues normally until the next key or button event is reported to the client\&. At this time, the specified device again appears to freeze\&. However, if the reported event causes the grab to be released, the specified device does not freeze\&. SyncThisDevice has no effect if the specified device is not frozen by the client or is not grabbed by the client\&.

.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
ReplayThisDevice \- If the specified device is actively grabbed by the client and is frozen as the result of an event having been sent to the client (either from the activation of a GrabDeviceButton or from a previous AllowDeviceEvents with mode SyncThisDevice, but not from a GrabDevice), the grab is released and that event is completely reprocessed\&. This time, however, the request ignores any passive grabs at or above (toward the root) that the grab\-window of the grab just released\&. The request has no effect if the specified device is not grabbed by the client or if it is not frozen as the result of an event\&.

.el \{\

AsyncOtherDevices \- If the remaining devices are frozen by the client, event processing for them continues as usual\&. If the other devices are frozen multiple times by the client on behalf of multiple grabs, AsyncOtherDevices "thaws" for all\&. AsyncOtherDevices has no effect if the devices are not frozen by the client\&.

SyncAll \- If all devices are frozen by the client, event processing (for all devices) continues normally until the next button or key event is reported to the client for a grabbed device, at which time all devices again appear to freeze\&. However, if the reported event causes the grab to be released, then the devices do not freeze\&. If any device is still grabbed, then a subsequent event for it will still cause all devices to freeze\&. SyncAll has no effect unless all devices are frozen by the client\&. If any device is frozen twice by the client on behalf of two separate grabs, SyncAll thaws for both\&. A subsequent freeze for SyncAll will only freeze each device once\&.

AsyncAll \- If all devices are frozen by the client, event processing for all devices continues normally\&. If any device is frozen multiple times by the client on behalf of multiple separate grabs, AsyncAll thaws for all\&. AsyncAll has no effect unless all devices are frozen by the client\&.
.RE
.sp
AsyncThisDevice, SyncThisDevice, and ReplayThisDevice have no effect on the processing of events from the remaining devices\&. AsyncOtherDevices has no effect on the processing of events from the specified device\&. When the event_mode is SyncAll or AsyncAll, the device parameter is ignored\&.
.sp
It is possible for several grabs of different devices by the same or different clients to be active simultaneously\&. If a device is frozen on behalf of any grab, no event processing is performed for the device\&. It is possible for a single device to be frozen because of several grabs\&. In this case, the freeze must be released on behalf of each grab before events can again be processed\&.
.sp
XAllowDeviceEvents can generate a BadDevice or BadValue error\&.
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
BadDevice
       An invalid device was specified\&. The specified device
       does not exist or has not been opened by this client via
       XOpenInputDevice\&. This error may also occur if the
       specified device is the X keyboard or X pointer device\&.
