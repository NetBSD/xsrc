# is actually compiled.
#
# A special case occurs when there's no VCS info we can find to work
# with, AND we have a pregen'd .in file (${vresion_c_gen}); this is
# commonly the case with a release tarball, where part of the release
# building process pre-stashes the bzr revision info.  In that case, we

# (which already has the VCS info), and make the second step just cp the
