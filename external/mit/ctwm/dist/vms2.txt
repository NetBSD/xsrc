What did I do for ctwm?				(Richard Levitte)
-----------------------

>>>> ctwm 3.5 beta 1:

19970301:

  Well, some bug fixes (a missing return at one place...  Baaaad...), fixing
  the restart code for VMS, a lot of extra declarations to make DEC C shut up,
  A real descrip.mms (and a descrip.submms), so you can compile for VAX and
  AXP without any file conflict, enhancements of make.com, ctwm.com and of
  the docs...

  Well, that's about it.

19970309:

  Peter Chang mentioned that XWD files are supported in DECWindows.  All
  you have to do is include decw$utils:xwdfile.h.  Unfortunatelly, that
  is not completelly true since that file has a fatal bug.  Fortunatelly,
  it's pretty easy to correct.  I do it the hard way though, by editing
  the places that are wrong and saving the result in the current directory.
  On the fly, of course :-).

  I also added support for the new file conventions that are used in the
  VMS port of xpm (version 3.4J).  This is also checked on the fly.

  A few bugs in the build procedures were removed at the same time.

19970318:

  DESCRIP.SUBMMS and MAKE.COM now deal with the copying of *.%_VMS on
  their own.  No more need for the user to rename those.

  A few quirks with the library option file making cleared.

  A few bugs with older X window system include files cleared.

  A .HLP file created (Thank you Michael Lemke!).

>>>> ctwm 3.5 beta 3:

19971115:

  Readded the following files that I have hacked on since the latest
  release of Ctwm 3.5 beta 1 for VMS (or that were forgotten back then):

	ALLOCA.C, CTWM.COM, DESCRIP.MMS, GENDEFTWMRC.COM,
	LEVITTE_SYSTEM.CTWMRC, MAKE.COM, README.VMS, VMS.TXT

  Added a few function declarations in the following files:

	CURSOR.H, MENUS.H, WORKMGR.H

  MENUS.C needed to include CURSOR.H for correct declaration of
  MakeStringCursor().  Also, I've removed (with #if 0..#endif) some code
  that Claude claims is already done in Done() (found in CTWM.C).  Tests
  have proved that he's right.

  I readded the sanity code in TWM.H for now, currently commented, to
  have if I need it on other platforms.

  WORKMGR.C: In VMS older than version 7.0, strdup() is not implemented,
  so I changed the code for VMS to do a malloc() and strcpy().
  [ N.B.: this was redesigned by Claude to redefine strdup() in UTIL.H
    instead. ]

Todo:
-----

There is some code around a select() in add_window.c that I have simply
#ifdef'ed out for VMS.  I'll deal with it as soon as I understand what
it is supposed to do.
