= CTWM Developer's Manual

Eventually, this will be a full compendium of all the information that a
Real CTWM Dev will already have in their head and never need to be
reminded of.


== Pages

(Should be organized better.  Or at all.)

* <<code_style.adoc#,Code Style>> covers coding style guidelines.

* <<functions.adoc#,f.functions>> talks about how the various
`f.whatever` functions are dispatched and how you'd go about writing one.

* <<rlayout.adoc#,RLayout>> describes the functions and data structures
involving `RArea` and `RLayout` bits.

* <<principles.adoc#,Principles Of Operation>> is a pre-existing dev
document that covers a number of areas.  Probably over time it'll get
piecewise integrated into bigger individual sections.

* <<links.adoc#,Links>> collections links to various manuals and
specifications and other reference material that are often of use.

* <<doxygen.adoc#,Doxygen>> discusses use of Doxygen to document the
source.
