To compile and install ctwm on VMS machines:

Unpacking and configuration:
----------------------------

0) You must have the X miscellaneous utilities and X extension libraries.
   Possibly, also have some unix type tools such as tar and gzip
   (get these from ftp.spc.edu in macros32/savesets).

1) Get the latest xpm library (at time of writing, 3.4) and compile that
   first. This is used for coloured icons. (There should be many sites that
   have a copy of xpm, try using Google to find a site near you. I found
   ftp://ftp2.cnam.fr/decwindows/lib/)

2) If you don't already have a working descrip.local, copy
   descrip.local-template to desrip.local:

   $ IF F$SEARCH("DESCRIP.LOCAL") .EQS. "" THEN -
	COPY DESCRIP.LOCAL-TEMPLATE DESCRIP.LOCAL

3) Edit descrip.local and change what needs to be changed.  There are fairly
   clear comments describing how it should be done.

   About EXIT_ENDSESSION, see warning W1 below.

Compilation and linking:
------------------------

4) This item is not true any more, because support for make.com and link.com
   has been removed.  MMK is free and works perfectly well.

   Was: 'IF YOU DOWNLOADED A PACKAGE WITH OBJECT FILES, you only need to link
   ctwm, doing "@link.com".  Then go to step 7).'

5) You do not need to rename the files with _VMS extensions any more.

6) build ctwm by doing "mmk/ign=w" (if you have DECSET, you can use MMS
   instead of MMK).  If you downloaded a package with object files, it
   should result in ctwm being linked only.

[ N.B.:  WHEN LINKING object files that have been compiled with VAX C
  (*.VAX_VAXC_OBJ), the linker may complain about two undefined symbols.
  They are however not refered to anywhere, so this is completelly harmless.
  The two symbols are COLORCONVERTARGS and SCREENCONVERTARG.

[ N.B.2:  The resulting executable will have the name CTWM.VAX_EXE or
  CTWM.AXP_EXE!  This because you may want to compile or link for both
  architectures in the same directory.			/Richard Levitte ]

Installation:
-------------

7) When ctwm has been successfully built, work out where to put the xpm
   icons, say disk$users:[joe.xpm]. Edit the file ctwm.com and change it to
   suit you.

8) Create your user config file ctwm.rc and put it in DECW$USER_DEFAULTS.
   Now is the time to read the man page on ctwm. Be sure to read vms.txt for
   differences between the Unix ctwm and the VMS version.
   (See peterc.ctwmrc or levitte_system.ctwmrc, for an example config file.)

9) [Optional] Create your own system default config file system.ctwmrc
   and put it in DECW$SYSTEM_DEFAULTS.

10) Go to the session manager and under the Options menu pick out the
    "Menus..." item. Make a menu item called "CT Window Manager" and enter the
    DCL command "@disk$users:[joe.com]ctwm.com", as an example.

11) Go to the session manager, again, and under the Options menu pick out
    the "Automatic Startup..." item. Take out your current window manager
    and replace it with ctwm using the "CT Window Manager" item you just
    created.

12) Now all is done. Exit from the session and log back in to try out ctwm.


WARNINGS:
---------

W1) [THIS APPLIES ON VAX ONLY!]

    It seems like some older DECwindows/Motif versions end their session
    like this:

	%decw$endsession -vueimage sys$system:.exe

    this is an internal Session Manager command.  If this is how it's
    done on your machine, you'd better not use the session ending features
    of ctwm at all, or you won't get back a login prompt when you end
    your session.  In such a case, EXIT_ENDSESSION must be set to 0, or
    you may get into trouble.

W2) Bitmap (xbm) files are sometimes stored in files with no extensions
    on older Unix X11 releases, which makes definitions like this work
    on those ("plaid" is the culprit here):

	WorkSpaces {
	    "One"   {"#619AAE" "white" "firebrick" "white" "plaid"}
	}

    Since those files have never been stored without extension on VMS,
    you have to rewrite such definitions like this:

	WorkSpaces {
	    "One"   {"#619AAE" "white" "firebrick" "white" "plaid.xbm"}
	}

    I has been discussed if you couldn't add a "dna=.xbm" parameter to
    the open() or fopen() that opens the bitmap file.  This would of
    course have been possible, if the loading of bitmap files wasn't
    done through the function XmuLocateBitmapFile().  Of course, you
    could as well hack ExpandFilename(), but that is less clean.  The
    Xmu library needs to be enhanced for this task.
