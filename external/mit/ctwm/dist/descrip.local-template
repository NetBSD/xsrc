# The following is quite similar to Imakefile.local in teh Unixly
# build, except the flags are MMS/MMK variables rather than C macros.
# To disable a feature, the flag MUST be set to the empty string.  To
# enable any particular feature, the flag variable must be set to
# something non-empty, preferably 1.
#
# Some of the things you can define also come with make variables that
# can be manipulated.  All such variables have names starting with
# USER_.

# Feature: Use IMCONV features.
# Uhmm, I really don't know what this is about. -- Richard Levitte
#
# The make variables USER_IMCONVLIBDIR and USER_IMCONVINCDIR can be
# used to configure library search paths and include file search paths
# to find the imconv libraries and header files.
#
# Example:
#
# IMCONV = 1
# USER_IMCONVLIBDIR = LOCAL_LIBRARIES:
# USER_IMCONVINCDIR = LOCAL_INCLUDES:
#
IMCONV =

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Feature: Use sounds
# If you want sound support through librplay, defined USE_SOUND.
#
# The make variables USER_SOUNDLIBDIR and USER_SOUNDINCDIR can be
# used to configure library search paths and include file search paths
# to find the rplay libraries and header files.
#
# Example:
#
# USE_SOUND = 1
# USER_SOUNDLIBDIR = LOCAL_LIBRARIES:
# USER_SOUNDINCDIR = LOCAL_INCLUDES:
#
USE_SOUND =

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Feature: Use XPM images
# If you want XPM support, define XPM.
#
# The make variables USER_XPMLIBDIR and USER_XPMINCDIR can be
# used to configure library search paths and include file search paths
# to find the rplay libraries and header files.
#
# Example:
#
# XPM = 1
# USER_XPMLIBDIR = LOCAL_LIBRARIES:
# USER_XPMINCDIR = LOCAL_INCLUDES:
#
XPM = 1
USER_XPMLIBDIR = [-.XPM-3_4J]
USER_XPMINCDIR = [-.XPM-3_4J.LIB]

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Feature: Use Jpeg images
# If you want JPEG support, define JPEG.
#
# The make variables USER_JPEGLIBDIR and USER_JPEGINCDIR can be
# used to configure library search paths and include file search paths
# to find the rplay libraries and header files.

# Example:
#
# JPEG = 1

# USER_JPEGINCDIR = LOCAL_INCLUDE:

# Feature: Using M4 to process the ctwm configuration file
# If you want to process the ctwm configuration file with m4, define

# Feature: Support for Gnome extensions
# If you want to build with Gnome extensions, define GNOME.
