.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
ctwm is a window manager for the X Window System.  It provides
titlebars, shaped windows, virtual screens (workspaces),
several forms of icon management, user\-defined macro functions,
click\-to\-type and pointer\-driven keyboard focus, and user\-specified
key and pointer button bindings.  It is actually
\f(CRtwm(1)\fP (Tab Window Manager) from the MIT X11 distribution
slightly modified to accommodate the use of several virtual screens
(workspaces). It is heavily inspired by the Hewlett\-Packard vuewm
window manager. In addition, ctwm can use coloured, shaped icons
and background root pixmaps in XPM format [from Arnaud Le Hors],
in JPEG using libjpeg,
and xwd files. ctwm can be compiled to
use any combination of the above icon/pixmap formats.
.sp
This program is usually started by the user\(cqs session manager or
startup script.  When used from \f(CRxdm(1)\fP or \f(CRxinit(1)\fP without
a session manager, ctwm is frequently executed in the foreground
as the last client.  When run this way, exiting ctwm causes the
X session to be terminated, shutting down the X server and killing off
any other running clients.
.sp
By default, application windows are surrounded by a \(lqframe\(rq with a
titlebar at the top and a special border around the window.  The titlebar
contains the window\(cqs name, a rectangle that is lit when the window is
receiving keyboard input, and function boxes known as \(lqtitlebuttons\(rq
at the left and right edges of the titlebar to which actions can be bound.
.sp
Pressing pointer Button1 (usually the left\-most button unless it has
been changed with \f(CRxmodmap\fP) on a titlebutton will invoke the
function associated with the button.  In the default interface,
windows are iconified by clicking (pressing and then immediately
releasing) the left titlebutton (which looks like a Dot).  Conversely,
windows are deiconified by clicking in the associated icon or entry in
the icon manager (see description of the variable
\f(CRShowIconManager\fP and of the function \f(CRf.showiconmgr\fP).
.sp
Windows are resized by pressing the right titlebutton (which resembles a
group of nested squares), dragging the pointer over edge that is to be
moved, and releasing the pointer when the outline of the window is the desired
size.  Similarly, windows are moved by pressing in the title or highlight
region, dragging a window outline to the new location, and then releasing
when the outline is in the desired position.  Just
clicking in the title or highlight region raises the window without moving it.
.sp
When new windows are created, ctwm will honor any size and location
information requested by the user (usually through \f(CR\-geometry\fP
command line argument or resources for the individual applications).
Otherwise, an outline of the window\(cqs default size, its titlebar, and lines
dividing the
window into a 3x3 grid that track the pointer are displayed.
Clicking pointer Button1
will position the window at the current position and give it the default
size.  Pressing pointer Button2 (usually the middle pointer button)
and dragging the outline
will give the window its current position but allow the sides to be resized as
described above.  Clicking pointer Button3 (usually the right pointer button)
will give the window its current position but attempt to make it long enough
to touch the bottom the screen.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\f(CRctwm\fP accepts the following command line options:
.sp
\-\-help, \-h
.RS 4
Print usage text.
.RE
.sp
\-\-display=\f(CRdpy\fP, \-d \f(CRdpy\fP
.RS 4
This option specifies the X server to use.
.RE
.sp
\-\-replace
.RS 4
This option indicates that it is not an error if a window manager
is already running.
In that case, the existing window manager is asked to quit,
and ctwm takes its place.
Available only if ctwm is built with the \f(CRUSE_EWMH\fP flag.
First appeared in 4.0.0.
.RE
.sp
\-\-single
.RS 4
This option indicates that only the default screen (as specified by
\f(CR\-\-display\fP or by the \f(CRDISPLAY\fP environment variable) should be
managed.  By default, ctwm will attempt to manage
all screens on the display.
.RE
.sp
\-\-cfgchk
.RS 4
This option causes ctwm to only try to parse the config file, and
indicate whether errors are found.
.RE
.sp
\-\-dumpcfg
.RS 4
This option causes ctwm to print out the compiled\-in fallback config.
First appeared in 4.0.0.
.RE
.sp
\-\-file=\f(CRfilename\fP, \-f \f(CRfilename\fP
.RS 4
This option specifies the name of the startup file to use.
ctwm will first try to load filename.num, where \f(CRnum\fP is the screen number.
If it fails, it will try to load filename.
By default, ctwm will look in the user\(cqs home directory for files
named \f(CR.ctwmrc.num\fP, \f(CR.ctwmrc\fP, \f(CR.twmrc.num\fP, or \f(CR.twmrc\fP (where \f(CRnum\fP is a screen number).
.RE
.sp
\-\-verbose, \-v
.RS 4
This option indicates that ctwm should print error messages whenever
an unexpected X Error event is received.  This can be useful when debugging
applications but can be distracting in regular use.
.RE
.sp
\-\-quiet, \-q
.RS 4
Disables \f(CR\-\-verbose\fP (useful for overriding aliases, etc).
.RE
.sp
\-\-nom4, \-n
.RS 4
This option indicates that ctwm should not filter the startup file
through \f(CRm4\fP. Available only if ctwm is built with the \f(CRUSE_M4\fP flag.
.RE
.sp
\-\-keep\-defs, \-k
.RS 4
This option indicates that ctwm should keep the definitions it
prepends to your startup file when filtering through \f(CRm4\fP in /tmp.
Available only if ctwm is built with the \f(CRUSE_M4\fP flag.
.RE
.sp
\-\-keep=\f(CRm4file\fP, \-K \f(CRm4file\fP
.RS 4
This option indicates that ctwm should keep the result of filtering
your startup file through \f(CRm4\fP in the named file.
Available only if ctwm is built with the \f(CRUSE_M4\fP flag.
.RE
.sp
\-\-mono
.RS 4
Run in monochrome mode.
.RE
.sp
\-\-version
.RS 4
ctwm just prints its version number.
.RE
.sp
\-\-info
.RS 4
ctwm prints its detailed version and compile time options.
.RE
.sp
\-\-nowelcome, \-W
.RS 4
This option tells ctwm not to display any welcome when starting.
.RE
.sp
\-\-clientId=\f(CRclid\fP, \-\-restore=\f(CRresfname\fP
.RS 4
Something to do with session management
.RE
.sp
\-\-xrm=\f(CRresource\fP
.RS 4
Ignored.
.RE
.sp
ctwm uses \f(CRgetopt_long()\fP for parsing the command\-line options.  This
means that args can be passed via \f(CR\-\-long=arg\fP and \f(CR\-\-long arg\fP, as well
as \f(CR\-l arg\fP and \f(CR\-larg\fP, and short args can be bundled like \f(CR\-vnk\fP as
well as \f(CR\-v \-n \-k\fP.
.SH "CUSTOMIZATION"
.sp
Much of ctwm\(cqs appearance and behavior can be controlled by providing
a startup file in one of the following locations (searched in order for
each screen being managed when ctwm begins):
.sp
$HOME/.ctwmrc.\f(CRscreennumber\fP
.RS 4
The \f(CRscreennumber\fP is a small positive number (e.g. 0, 1, etc.)
representing the screen number (e.g. the last number in the DISPLAY environment
variable \f(CRhost:displaynum.screennum\fP) that would be used to contact that
screen of the display.  This is intended for displays with multiple screens of
differing visual types.
.RE
.sp
$HOME/.ctwmrc
.RS 4
This is the usual name for an individual user\(cqs startup file.
.RE
.sp
$HOME/.twmrc.\f(CRscreennumber\fP, $HOME/.twmrc
.RS 4
The users twm startup file.
.RE
.sp
@ETCDIR@/system.ctwmrc
.RS 4
If none of the preceding files are found, ctwm will look in this
file for a
default configuration.  This is often tailored by the site administrator to
provide convenient menus or familiar bindings for novice users.
.RE
.sp
If no startup files are found, ctwm will use the built\-in defaults
described above.  The only resource used by ctwm is
\f(CRbitmapFilePath\fP for a colon\-separated list of directories to search
when looking for bitmap files (for more information, see the \f(CRAthena
Widgets\fP manual and \f(CRxrdb(1)\fP).
.sp
ctwm startup files are logically broken up into three types of
specifications:  \f(CRVariables\fP, \f(CRBindings\fP, \f(CRMenus\fP.  The
\f(CRVariables\fP section must come first and is used to describe the
fonts, colors, cursors, border widths, icon and window placement, highlighting,
autoraising, layout of titles, warping, use of the icon manager.
The \f(CRBindings\fP section usually comes second and is used to specify
the functions that should be
invoked when keyboard and pointer buttons are pressed in
windows, icons, titles, and frames.  The \f(CRMenus\fP section gives any
user\-defined menus (containing functions to be invoked or
commands to be executed).
.sp
Variable names and keywords are case\-insensitive.  Strings must be
surrounded by double quote characters (e.g. \(lqblue\(rq) and are
case\-sensitive.  A pound sign (&#35;) outside of a string causes the
remainder of the line in which the character appears to be treated as
a comment.
.SH "M4 PREPROCESSING"
.sp
ctwm can use \f(CRm4(1)\fP to pre\-process its setup files.  The availability of
the m4 preprocessing is dependent on the build option \f(CRUSE_M4\fP (on by
default), and can be selectively disabled with the \f(CR\-\-nom4\fP command\-line
argument.
.sp
When ctwm starts up, it opens a file for input as described above.
But, it processes that file through \f(CRm4\fP before parsing it. So, you can
use m4 macros to perform operations at runtime.  This makes it very
easy to work when you use many different displays, with different characteristics.
For example, If you want to set the lower right section of the screen to be your
\f(CRIconRegion\fP, (see below for details on the \f(CRIconRegion\fP variable)
you can use m4 directives and pre\-defined symbols to calculate the region
you want.  For example:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
define(IRegion, translit(eval(WIDTH/3)*eval(HEIGHT/2)+eval(WIDTH\-WIDTH/3)\-0, *, x))
IconRegion  "IRegion" SOUTH EAST 75 25
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
will define the lower half, and right\-hand third of the screen.  The
above makes use of symbols that are predefined for m4 by ctwm.  The
symbols WIDTH and HEIGHT are among those calculated by ctwm and written
into a temporary file for \f(CRm4\fP to use.
.sp
You may well find that if you research the \f(CRm4(1)\fP manual well,
and understand the power of m4, this will be a \fIvery\fP
useful and powerful tool.  But, if you use any of the symbols
which are predefined by m4, you are in severe danger!  For example,
the Sun \f(CRm4\fP predefines shift, so if you use that name in your \f(CR.ctwmrc\fP,
you are out of luck.
.sp
The following symbols are predefined by ctwm:
.SS "Hostnames"
.sp
SERVERHOST
.RS 4
This variable is set to the name of the machine that is running the X
server.
.RE
.sp
CLIENTHOST
.RS 4
The machine that is running the clients.  (ie, ctwm)
.RE
.sp
HOSTNAME
.RS 4
As of 4.0.2, this is a duplicate of \f(CRCLIENTHOST\fP.  In prior
versions, \f(CRgethostbyname()\fP was used to attempt to derive a canonical
or fully\-qualified version of the hostname.
.RE
.SS "User Info"
.sp
USER
.RS 4
The name of the user running the program.  Value taken from
environmental variables \f(CR$USER\fP and \f(CR$LOGNAME\fP, or from the passwd
lookup for your uid if they don\(cqt exist.  Falls back to \(lqunknown\(rq if
all methods fail.
.RE
.sp
HOME
.RS 4
The user\(cqs home directory.  Gotten from the environment var \f(CR$HOME\fP.
.RE
.SS "ctwm info"
.sp
TWM_TYPE
.RS 4
Tells which \f(CRtwm\fP offshoot is running.  It will always be set to
the string \(lqctwm\(rq in this program.  This is useful for protecting
parts of your \f(CR.twmrc\fP file that twm proper won\(cqt understand
(like \f(CRWorkSpaces\fP) so that it is still usable with other
\f(CRtwm\fP programs.
.RE
.sp
TWM_VERSION
.RS 4
Tells which ctwm version is running in the form of a floating
point number.
.RE
.sp
CTWM_VERSION_MAJOR, CTWM_VERSION_MINOR, CTWM_VERSION_PATCH, CTWM_VERSION_ADDL
.RS 4
Gives the ctwm version split out.  e.g., for a version like
"3.8.2\-beta1", the \f(CR_MAJOR\fP will be "3", \f(CR_MINOR\fP "8", \f(CR_PATCH\fP "2",
and \f(CR_ADDL\fP "\-beta1".  Final releases will generally have an empty
\f(CRCTWM_VERSION_ADDL\fP; it\(cqs mostly meaningful in dev and betas.  For
comparison, in this situation, TWM_VERSION will be "3.8.2".
.sp
The \f(CRCTWM_VERSION_*\fP variables first appeared in 4.0.0.

.RE
.SH "VARIABLES"
.sp
Many of the aspects of ctwm\(cqs user interface are controlled by variables
that may be set in the user\(cqs startup file.  Some of the options are
enabled or disabled simply by the presence of a particular keyword.  Other
options require keywords, numbers, strings, or lists of all of these.
.sp
Lists are surrounded by braces and are usually separated by
whitespace or a newline.  For example:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
AutoRaise { "emacs" "XTerm" "Xmh" }
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
or
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
AutoRaise
{
    "emacs"
    "XTerm"
    "Xmh"
}
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
When a variable containing a list of strings representing windows is
searched (e.g. to determine whether or not to enable autoraise as shown
above), a string must be an exact, case\-sensitive match to the window\(cqs
name (given by various window properties, such as \f(CRWM_NAME\fP), resource
name or class name (both given by the \f(CRWM_CLASS\fP window property).  The
preceding example would enable autoraise on windows named \(lqemacs\(rq as
well as any \f(CRxterm\fP (since they are of class \(lqXTerm\(rq) or xmh windows
(which are of class \(lqXmh\(rq).
.sp
String arguments that are interpreted as filenames (see the \f(CRPixmaps\fP,
\f(CRCursors\fP, and \f(CRIconDirectory\fP below) will
prepend the user\(cqs directory
(specified by the \f(CRHOME\fP environment variable) if the first character is a
tilde (~).  If, instead, the first character is a colon (:), the name is
assumed to refer to one of the internal bitmaps that are used to
create the default titlebars symbols:  \f(CR:xlogo\fP
or \f(CR:iconify\fP (both refer to the
X used for the iconify button), \f(CR:resize\fP (the nested squares used by the
resize button), and \f(CR:question\fP (the question mark used for non\-existent
bitmap files).
.sp
The following variables may be specified at the top of a ctwm startup
file.  Lists of window name prefix strings are indicated by \f(CRwin\-list\fP.
Optional arguments are shown in square brackets:
.sp
AlwaysOnTop { \f(CRwin\-list\fP }
.RS 4
This variable specifies a list of windows (all windows if the list is defaulted)
that ctwm will try its best to maintain on top of others. This doesn\(cqt
work in all case.
.RE
.sp
AlwaysShowWindowWhenMovingFromWorkspaceManager
.RS 4
When \f(CRReallyMoveInWorkspaceManager\fP is present and the user is moving
a window from the WorkSpaceMap, ctwm display the actual window only
if it crosses the current active workspace. If
\f(CRAlwaysShowWindowWhenMovingFromWorkspaceManager\fP is present, the actual
window is always visible during the move, regardless of whether it crosses
the current workspace or not. The Shift key toggles this behaviour.
.RE
.sp
AlwaysSqueezeToGravity [{ \f(CRwin\-list\fP }]
.RS 4
This variable indicates that ctwm should obey window gravity
when squeezing a window even when the window has a titlebar.
Normally, ctwm will always squeeze a window that has a titlebar
toward the north.
The optional \f(CRwin\-list\fP may be used to control which windows
this applies on.
.RE
.sp
AnimationSpeed \f(CRspeed\fP
.RS 4
The \f(CRspeed\fP argument is a non\-negative integer. It determines the number of
times a second animations (if any) are updated. If \f(CRspeed\fP is 0, animations
are freezed. The default value is 0.
.RE
.sp
AutoFocusToTransients
.RS 4
Transient windows get focus automatically when created.  Useful with
programs that have keyboard shortcuts that pop up windows.
.RE
.sp
AutoLower [{ \f(CRwin\-list\fP }]
.RS 4
This variable specifies a list of windows (all windows if the list is
defaulted) to be automatically lowered whenever the pointer leaves a
window.  This action can be interactively enabled or disabled on
individual windows using the function \f(CRf.autolower\fP.
.RE
.sp
AutoOccupy
.RS 4
This variable specifies that clients will automatically change their occupation
when their name or icon name changes. The new occupation will be recalculated
from the Occupy and OccupyAll fields in the \f(CR.ctwmrc\fP file.
.RE
.sp
AutoPopup [{ \f(CRwin\-list\fP }]
.RS 4
This variables specifies a list of windows which will be deiconified whenever
their name changes. Can be used for xconsole, for instance,which adds a "*" to
its name whenever something gets displayed on the console, or for various mail
readers who change their icons depending on the presence of unread mail.
.sp
First appeared in 4.0.0.
.RE
.sp
AutoPriority
.RS 4
This variable specifies that ctwm should automatically recompute the
priority of a window (and its associated icon) when its name changes.
See also \f(CROnTopPriority\fP.
.sp
First appeared in 4.0.0.
.RE
.sp
AutoRaise [{ \f(CRwin\-list\fP }]
.RS 4
This variable specifies a list of windows (all windows if the list is defaulted)
to be automatically raised whenever the pointer has come to rest in a window for
the amount of time specified by the \f(CRRaiseDelay\fP variable. This action can be
interactively enabled or disabled on individual windows using the function
\f(CRf.autoraise\fP.
.RE
.sp
AutoRaiseIcons
.RS 4
Icons are raised when the cursor enters it. Useful with ShrinkIconTitles.
.RE
.sp
AutoRelativeResize
.RS 4
This variable indicates that dragging out a window size (either when
initially sizing the window with pointer Button2 or when resizing it)
should not wait until the pointer has crossed the window edges.
Instead, moving
the pointer automatically causes the nearest edge or edges to move by the
same amount.  This allows the resizing of windows that extend off
the edge of the screen.
If the pointer is
in the center of the window, or if the resize is begun by pressing a
titlebutton, ctwm will still wait for the pointer to cross a window
edge (to prevent accidents).  This option is
particularly useful for people who like the press\-drag\-release method of
sweeping out window sizes.
.RE
.sp
AutoSqueeze { \f(CRwin\-list\fP }
.RS 4
These windows will be auto\-squeezed (see f.squeeze). i.e. automatically
unsqueezed when they get focus, and squeezed when they loose it. Useful for
the workspace manager. Not authorized for icon managers.
.RE
.sp
BackingStore
.RS 4
Enable usage of backing store on menus and workspace map windows.  See
also \f(CRNoBackingStore\fP.  Added in 4.0.0; in previous versions this
was the default.
.RE
.sp
BeNiceToColormap
.RS 4
By defaults new colors are allocated for shadows when a 3D look is used,
but when you specify \f(CRBeNiceToColormap\fP ctwm uses stipling instead of
new colors, the effect is less beautiful, but acceptable. In this case
ClearShadowContrast and DarkShadowContrast have no effects.

disappear when a program\(cqs custom colors are installed by the window
manager.

SqueezeTitle [{ \f(CRsqueeze\-list\fP }]
.RS 4
This variable indicates that ctwm should attempt to use the SHAPE

The optional \f(CRsqueeze\-list\fP
may be used to control the location of the squeezed titlebar along the
top of the window.  It contains entries of the form:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C

.if n .RE
.sp
where \f(CRname\fP is a window name, \f(CRjustification\fP is either \f(CRleft\fP,
\f(CRcenter\fP, or \f(CRright\fP, and \f(CRnum\fP and \f(CRdenom\fP
are numbers specifying a ratio giving the relative position about which
the titlebar is justified.  The ratio is measured from left to right if
the numerator is positive, and right to left if negative.  A denominator
of 0 indicates that the numerator should be interpreted as pixels.
For compatibility, the pixel\-position 0/0 is the relative  middle  of
the window (1/2) for \f(CRcenter\fP and the relative right side of the
window (2/2) for \f(CRright\fP, but this use is not recommended.
Use "right 2 2" for relative positioning, or "right \-1 0" for absolute;
this makes a difference when  dragging  the  titlebar (see
\f(CRf.movetitlebar\fP).
For example:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
SqueezeTitle
{
    "XTerm"   left    0  0
    "xterm1"  left    1  3

specified), most users will want to have their most common operations
bound to key and button strokes.  To do this, ctwm associates names
with each of the primitives and provides user\-defined functions for
building higher level primitives and menus for interactively selecting
among groups of functions.
.SS "Modifiers and Contexts"
.sp
The \f(CRmodlist\fP allows specifying different bindings for a button or key
when modifiers are applied.  The list of recognized modifier names
(abbreviated) are
\f(CRshift\fP (\f(CRs\fP),
\f(CRcontrol\fP (\f(CRc\fP),
\f(CRlock\fP (\f(CRl\fP),
\f(CRalter1\fP (\f(CRa1\fP),
\f(CRalter2\fP (\f(CRa2\fP),
\f(CRalter3\fP (\f(CRa3\fP),
\f(CRalter4\fP (\f(CRa4\fP),
\f(CRalter5\fP (\f(CRa5\fP),
\f(CRmeta\fP (\f(CRm\fP),
\f(CRmod1\fP (\f(CRm1\fP),
\f(CRmod2\fP (\f(CRm2\fP),
\f(CRmod3\fP (\f(CRm3\fP),
\f(CRmod4\fP (\f(CRm4\fP),
and \f(CRmod5\fP (\f(CRm5\fP).
Multiple modifiers may be applied to a single line by combining them with
a vertical bar (\f(CR|\fP).  For example:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
# Open the "top" menu with a Button1 (usually left mouse button) click in
# the root window
Button1 =        : root : f.menu "top"

# Open the "top2" menu with shift\-click
Button1 =     s  : root : f.menu "top2"

# And "top3" when control\-shift\-click
Button1 = c | s  : root : f.menu "top3"
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
The \f(CRlock\fP modifier refers to CapsLock.  \f(CRmeta\fP is generally your Alt
key.  \f(CRmod1\fP is the same as \f(CRmeta\fP.  \f(CRmod2..5\fP can have various special
meanings; try running \f(CRxmodmap \-pm\fP to see how your X server is mapping
things (the \f(CRxkeycaps\fP program may also be useful).  The \f(CRalter1..5\fP
modifiers refer to ctwm alternate keymaps; see the description of
\f(CRf.altkeymap\fP below for details.
.sp
Note that if you\(cqre using the \f(CRm4\fP preprocessor, most implementations
define a \f(CRshift\fP macro internally, so using that as a modifier will
silently fail to work right.  To get around it, you\(cqll need to quote it
so that \f(CRm4\fP passes it through as a literal string: \f(CR`shift\*(Aq\fP.
.sp
The \f(CRcontext\fP lets you specify which mappings apply based on where the
pointer currently is on the screen.  The available options are
\f(CRwindow\fP (\f(CRw\fP),
\f(CRtitle\fP (\f(CRt\fP),
\f(CRicon\fP (\f(CRi\fP),
\f(CRroot\fP (\f(CRr\fP),
\f(CRframe\fP (\f(CRf\fP),
\f(CRworkspace\fP (no abbreviation),
\f(CRiconmgr\fP (\f(CRm\fP), and
\f(CRalter\fP (\f(CRa\fP).
Like the modifiers above, they may be combined with a vertical bar, which
allows you to bind an action in multiple contexts at once.
Alternately, \f(CRall\fP can be given for the context to specify that the
binding should happen everywhere.  It\(cqs equivalent to combining all the
choices (except \f(CRalter\fP, which is special).
.sp
The \f(CRalter\fP context allows binding the function when in the alternate
context; see the \f(CRf.altcontext\fP function below for details.
.sp
There is an additional possible magical value for \f(CRcontext\fP; if you
provide a quoted string (e.g., \f(CR"MyXterm"\fP) for the context of a key (but
not button) binding, then that binding will trigger the given function in
window context to all windows matching that name.  e.g.,
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
# Pressing "F1" anywhere on the screen will cause all windows with name
# "xterm" to raise themselves.
"F1" = : "xterm" : f.raise
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
Beware that this can have odd side effects if multiple windows are
matched, especially if the function can conflict one with the other
(e.g., in the example above, if two "xterm" windows overlap each other).
.SS "Functions"
.sp
The \f(CRfunction\fP in a binding is any of the \f(CRf.\fP keywords described below.
For example, the default startup file contains the following bindings:
.sp
.if n .RS 4

Button1 =   : root          : f.menu "TwmWindows"
Button1 = m : window | icon : f.function "move\-or\-lower"
Button2 = m : window | icon : f.iconify
Button3 = m : window | icon : f.function "move\-or\-raise"
Button1 =   : title         : f.function "move\-or\-raise"
Button2 =   : title         : f.raiselower

.SH "MENUS"
.sp
Functions may be grouped and interactively selected using pop\-up
(when bound to a pointer button) or pull\-down (when associated
with a titlebutton) menus.  Each menu specification contains the name of the
menu as it will be referred to by \f(CRf.menu\fP, optional default
foreground and background colors, the list of item names and the functions
they should invoke, and optional foreground and background colors for
individual items:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
Menu "menuname" [ ("deffg":"defbg") ]
{
    string1  [ ("fg1":"bg1") ]  function1
    string2  [ ("fg2":"bg2") ]  function2

    stringN  [ ("fgN":"bgN") ]  functionN
}
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
The \f(CRmenuname\fP is case\-sensitive.
The optional \f(CRdeffg\fP and \f(CRdefbg\fP arguments specify the foreground
and background colors used on a color display
to highlight menu entries.
The \f(CRstring\fP portion
of each menu entry will be the text which will appear in the menu.
The optional \f(CRfgN\fP and \f(CRbgN\fP arguments specify the foreground
and background colors of the menu entry when the pointer is not in
the entry.  These colors will only be used on a color display.  The
default is to use the colors specified by the
\f(CRMenuForeground\fP and \f(CRMenuBackground\fP variables.
The \f(CRfunction\fP portion of the menu entry is one of the functions,
including any user\-defined functions, or additional menus.
.sp
If an entry name begins with a \(lq*\(rq (star), this star won\(cqt be displayed and
the corresponding entry will be the default entry for this menu. When a menu
has a default entry and is used as a submenu of another menu, this default entry
action will be executed automatically when this submenu is selected without being
displayed. It\(cqs hard to explain, but easy to understand.
.SS "Special Menus"
.sp
There are several special menus.
.sp
\f(CRTwmWindows\fP contains the names of all of the client and ctwm\-supplied
windows in the current workspace.  Selecting an entry will cause the
\f(CRWindowFunction\fP to be executed on that window.  If \f(CRWindowFunction\fP
hasn\(cqt been set, the window will be deiconified and raised.
.sp
\f(CRTwmVisible\fP lists those windows which are currently deiconified (first

\f(CRTwmIcons\fP lists only those which are currently iconified.
.sp

described above, except that they show windows in all workspaces, rather
than just the current one.
.sp
\f(CRTwmWorkspaces\fP contains the names of your workspaces, selecting an entry
goto this workspace. In addition, these entries have submenus containing
the names of all windows occupying this workspace, selecting such an
entry executes \f(CRf.warpto\fP on this window.
.sp
\f(CRTwmKeys\fP lists all the keybindings in the root context that invoke
\f(CRf.exec\fP.  First appeared in 3.7.
.SH "ICONS"
.sp
ctwm supports several different ways of manipulating iconified windows.
The common pixmap\-and\-text style may be laid out by hand or automatically
arranged as described by the \f(CRIconRegion\fP variable.  In addition, a
terse grid of icon names, called an icon manager, provides a more efficient
use of screen space as well as the ability to navigate among windows from
the keyboard.
.sp
An icon manager is a window that contains names of selected or all
windows currently on the display.  In addition to the window name,
a small button using the default iconify symbol will be displayed to the
left of the name when the window is iconified.  By default, clicking on an
entry in the icon manager performs \f(CRf.iconify\fP.
To change the actions taken in the icon manager, use the
the \f(CRiconmgr\fP context when specifying button and keyboard bindings.
.sp
Moving the pointer into the icon manager also directs keyboard focus to
the indicated window (setting the focus explicitly or else sending synthetic
events \f(CRNoTitleFocus\fP is set).
Using the \f(CRf.upiconmgr\fP, \f(CRf.downiconmgr\fP
\f(CRf.lefticonmgr\fP, and
\f(CRf.righticonmgr\fP functions,
the input focus can be changed between windows directly from the
keyboard.
.SH "X WINDOW PROPERTIES"
.sp
As a window manager, ctwm reads and sets a huge variety of properties on
the windows it manages and the windows it creates.  Most of that is
beyond the scope of user documentation.  However, a few points are worth
mentioning.
.SS "Window Naming"
.sp
Windows get their names via X properties.  There are two types of names;
the window name (which is what shows up in the titlebar, the \f(CRf.identify\fP
window, etc), and the icon name (which shows up on the icon and on the
icon manager).
.sp
Prior to 4.0.2, ctwm only supported the standard ICCCM properties for
setting the window and icon names.  These are \f(CRWM_NAME\fP for the window
name, and \f(CRWM_ICON_NAME\fP for the icon name.  As of 4.0.2, ctwm also
supports the EWMH versions of these, which are \f(CR_NET_WM_NAME\fP and
\f(CR_NET_WM_ICON_NAME\fP.  If the EWMH variants exist, they\(cqre used in
preference to the older ICCCM style.
.sp
As of 4.0.2, ctwm also supports an additional pair of properties;
\f(CRCTWM_WM_NAME\fP and \f(CRCTWM_WM_ICON_NAME\fP, which override all the others.
These are specifically intended for the user to manually set, not for
programs to set themselves.  This allows the user to override programs
that name themselves unhelpfully, or to otherwise label things to their
liking.
.sp
You can set these via any method you\(cqd use to set window properties.
From the command line, the \f(CRxprop(1)\fP tool is widely available, if a
little clunky.  So, for instance, to set the icon name of a window
(changing how it looks in the icon manager), but leave the window name
alone as the program itself normally sets it (leaving the titlebar
normal), you could run a command like:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
xprop \-f CTWM_WM_ICON_NAME 8u \-set CTWM_WM_ICON_NAME "I hate this window"
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
and then click the window you want to set it on.  Unfortunately,
\f(CRxprop(1)\fP does require you to specify the property name when defining
the format, as well as when setting it, so it\(cqs a little ugly.  The \f(CR8u\fP
means you\(cqre giving a UTF\-8 string.  Other possible formats are \f(CR8s\fP for
a plain 7\-bit \f(CRSTRING\fP (i.e, plain ASCII), and \f(CR8t\fP for
\(lqinternationalized\(rq ICCCM\-style \f(CRCOMPOUND_TEXT\fP.  Usually you\(cqd just
use UTF\-8 though.  \f(CRxprop \-remove CTWM_WM_ICON_NAME\fP and click would let
you undo it and go back to the normal naming.  See the \f(CRxprop(1)\fP manual
for more.
.SH "SOUNDS"
.sp
If built with the \f(CRUSE_SOUND\fP option, ctwm is able to play sounds
for any X event.  This may be configured in two ways.
.sp
As of 4.0.0, the sounds may be configured in the ctwmrc with the
\f(CRRplaySounds\fP config parameter.  See above for details.
.sp
If that is not found, or in older versions, ctwm will look for the file
\f(CR.ctwm\-sounds\fP in the user\(cqs home directory to map every X event to a
sound file to be played.  Each line in \f(CR.ctwm\-sounds\fP has the following
syntax:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
{X event}: {sound file}
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
If \f(CRRplaySounds\fP is given in the config file, and \f(CR.ctwm\-sounds\fP exists,
a warning will be given, and the contents of \f(CR.ctwm\-sounds\fP will be
ignored.  All support for \f(CR.ctwm\-sounds\fP will be removed in a future
version, leaving only the ctwmrc configuration method available
.sp
However configured, the currently known X events that can be given are:
.sp
