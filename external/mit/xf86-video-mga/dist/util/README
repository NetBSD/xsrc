author:		ajv 

purpose: 	to display MGA Storm's dwg register in human readable output.

compilation:	cc -o stormdwg stormdwg.c or just type make

usage:		stormdwg hexval

hexval will then be decomposed into it's constituent parts and displayed in human
readable format. 

BUGS:		none known except that it needs to kept up to date if the storms
		spec is changed

NOTE:		This is not by itself a very usable utility.
