                            Patch #392 - 2024/05/22

     * improve  input decoding for non-Latin1 character sets by preserving
       the sense of GL/GR.
     * add  resource  preferLatin1  to simplify UPSS configuration (Gentoo
       #932154).
     * build-fix  for --disable-boxchars; patch #390 reuses that feature's
       code  to draw the part of the DEC Technical character set which has
       no Unicode equivalent.
     * modify #include of pty.h to work with musl (report by Khem Raj).
     * improve    definitions    used    in    clock_gettime    logic   in
       graphics_sixel.c, as well as updating comments (patch by Ben Wong).
     * amend allowC1Printable changes from patch #391, restoring a special
       case  which  caused C1 characters to be ignored (report/testcase by
       Dmytro Bagrii).
