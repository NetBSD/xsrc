.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP \fIdpy\fP 1i
Specifies the connection to the X server.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Xpresent
is a library designed to interface the X Present Extension.
The Present extension provides a way for applications to update their
window contents from a pixmap in a well defined fashion, synchronizing
with the display refresh and potentially using a more efficient
mechanism than copying the contents of the source pixmap.
The
.B XPresentQueryExtension
function checks if the X server specified by \fIdpy\fP supports the X Present
extension.  If the server does not support the extension, it returns False.
If the server does support the extension, it returns True, and sets the
values of \fImajor_opcode_return\fP, \fIevent_base_return\fP, and
\fIerror_base_return\fP if the pointers are not NULL.
.PP
Clients must call the 
.B XPresentQueryExtension
function to verify the server supports the extension before calling any other
function for this extension.
The
.B XPresentQueryVersion
function sets the values pointed to by \fImajor_version_return\fP and
\fIminor_version_return\fP to the version of the extension supported
by the X server specified by \fIdpy\fP.
The
.B XPresentQueryVersion
function returns the version of the libXpresent library in use, as defined
by the \fBPRESENT_VERSION\fP macro in <X11/extensions/Xpresent.h>.
