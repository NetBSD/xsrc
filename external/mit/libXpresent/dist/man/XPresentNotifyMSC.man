.SH NAME
XPresentNotifyMSC \- X Present Extension
.SH SYNTAX
\&#include <X11/extensions/Xpresent.h>
.nf
.sp
void XPresentNotifyMSC \^(\^Display *\fIdisplay\fP,
	Window \fIwindow\fP,
	uint32_t \fIserial\fP,
	uint64_t \fItarget_msc\fP,
	uint64_t \fIdivisor\fP,
	uint64_t \fIremainder\fP\^)\^;
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B XPresentNotifyMSC
requests that the X server specified by \fIdisplay\fP
deliver a \fBPresentCompleteNotifyEvent\fP with kind
\fBPresentCompleteKindNotifyMSC\fP after the time specified by
\fItarget-msc\fP, \fIdivisor\fP and \fIremainder\fP.
.PP
\fIserial\fP is an arbitrary client-specified value which will be
returned in the event so that the client can associate the
event and request.
.PP
If \fItarget-msc\fP is greater than the current Media Stream Counter (msc)
for \fIwindow\fP, the event will be delivered at (or after) the \fItarget-msc\fP
field. Otherwise, the event delivery will occur after the next
field where msc % \fIdivisor\fP == \fIremainder\fP.
.PP
If \fIwindow\fP is destroyed before the event is delivered, then
the event delivery will not be completed.
