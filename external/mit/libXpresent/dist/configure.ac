# Version should match the current XPresent version. XPresentQueryVersion
# returns the version from xpresentwire.h, NOT the version we set here. But we
# try to keep these the same.  Note that the library has an extra
# digit in the version number to track changes which don't affect the
# protocol, so Xpresent version l.n.m corresponds to protocol version l.n,
# that 'revision' number appears in Xpresent.h and has to be manually
# synchronized.
