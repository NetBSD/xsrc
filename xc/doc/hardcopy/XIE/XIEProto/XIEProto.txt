Preface
The X architecture was a major step towards defining open, interactive application display services. X 
pried apart the tightly coupled, private interconnect which has existed between application and display 
subsystem by specifying a minimal, structured service set.
To retain a consistent, minimal core service set and yet accommodate evolving application require-
ments, X provides a method for extending the core protocol with additional domain specific requests. 
This document defines an X extension for the imaging domain.  It is the fifth version of the X Image 
Extension Protocol proposal and, as prior readers will immediately recognize, it is a lineal descendent of 
the other four. 
Since the purpose of this document is to provide a clear, concise articulation of the protocol, expository 
materials have been pared to a bare minimum.  It is assumed that the reader has a measure of conceptual 
knowledge about imaging. 
Readers who lack familiarity with the X Window System are encouraged to begin with a selection from

Acknowledgments
We are all indebted to Digital Equipment Corporation where the X Image Extension was originally 
conceived.  They persevered through numerous protocol reviews and revisions and provided the initial 
sample implementations.  Their efforts contributed greatly towards promoting XIE into the Public Re-
view process. 
This document evolved from original specifications authored by Joe Mauro.  We hope that it still shows 
some of his architectural strength and elegance.  The majority of the current document (through version 
4.11) was authored by Bob Shelley while employed at Digital.  Subsequent revisions were made at AGE 
Logic.
The current view of pipelines emerged almost completely intact from a single, terse email message from 
Bob Scheifler and Keith Packard. 
The need for robust geometric transforms was first promoted by Ben Fahy.  We are grateful that he has 
provided us with detailed documentation for the basic geometry element and several retrospective 
sampling algorithms. 
While one could debate that XIE is too big or too small, we can thank Jim Fulton for spearheading the 
effort to define a smaller gentler XIE, the Document Imaging Subset.

Introduction
Scope and Purpose
This document specifies the X wire protocol for the X Image Extension (XIE).  It defines the syntax, 
structure, and semantics of XIE protocol elements.  It does not contain background material on imaging 
concepts which the protocol extension enables, nor does it contain any language specific bindings. 
Terminology
This specification contains a certain amount of descriptive terminology that is commonly used within 
the image processing community.  There is also parametric terminology that is used to describe the pa-
rameter types recognized by the core X protocol and the image extension protocol.  The image exten-
sion protocol types are defined in this document.
Techniques
For some XIE operations, there are several recognized algorithms or techniques which offer varying 
tradeoffs between quality of results and performance.  Also, in some cases, different techniques are re-
quired due to an image's class or content.  In order to accommodate some flexibility in this area, such 
XIE operations accept a technique parameter.  A description of the techniques specified in this docu-
ment can be found in Appendix A.  Individual implementations may extend XIE's capabilities by provid-
ing additional techniques to provide for particular market needs. 
Service Classes
For some environments, such as simple document image viewing, the full set of services provided by 
XIE may include features that are not needed by the target applications. In such situations (particularly 
for entry-level monochrome displays), server implementors may wish to provide only a subset of the full 
XIE protocol.
Subsets are arranged in a nested hierarchy of service classes.  Each service class includes all of the 
features of any subsets that it surrounds (similar to the layers of an onion).  Thus, applications written 
to use a given subset of the protocol will function correctly when running on servers that implement an 
enveloping service class.


This version of the XIE protocol defines two class: the full protocol (Full), and a document imaging 
subset (DIS).  Future versions of the XIE protocol may define additional service classes.

A complete list of types, techniques, protocol requests, pipeline elements, events, and errors that are 
included in DIS can be found in Appendix B.

Specification Syntax
This section presents syntactic conventions which are adhered to throughout this specification. 
General Syntax
In general, the extension package follows the X11 protocol syntax conventions. Additions to this 
syntax are:
*	The syntax ( . . . ) encloses a set of alternative values.

Syntax of Protocol Encodings
Requests
# of Bytes	Value	Description
1	CARD8	XIE major opcode
1	CARD8	XIE minor opcode
2	CARD16	request length (total bytes divided by 4)
N		parameters required by the minor opcode
< 4		pad (if required)
Requests consist of four (4) bytes of header followed by zero (0) or more additional bytes of data.  If 
additional bytes of data are needed the entire request is padded to a multiple of four (4) bytes.  The 
common fields (major/minor opcode and length) are not included in XieReq request definitions.  Bytes 
not used by a specific minor opcode are not guaranteed to be zero.
Replies
# of Bytes	Value	Description
1	1	Reply
1		available for reply data
2	CARD16	sequence number of corresponding request
4	CARD32	reply length (extra data bytes divided by 4)
24		available for reply data
N		extra data beyond standard reply packet
< 4		pad (if required)
Replies consist of thirty-two (32) bytes followed by zero (0) or more extra bytes of data.  If extra bytes of 
data are needed the entire reply is padded to a multiple of four (4) bytes.  The common fields (Reply, 
sequence number, and length) are not included in XieReq reply definitions.  Bytes not used by the reply 
from a specific request are not guaranteed to be zero.
PhotoElements
# of Bytes	Value	Description
2	CARD16	element type
2	CARD16	element length (bytes divided by 4)
multiple of 2	XieTyp(Phototag|Tile)	element's data source(s) (if required)
N		parameters as required by element type
< 4		pad (if required)
A photo element consists of four (4) bytes of header, followed by zero (0) or more bytes of element in-
put connection definitions, followed by zero (0) or more bytes or additional data.  The entire element 
definition is padded to a multiple of four (4) bytes.  The common fields (element type and element 
length) are not included in XieFlo element definitions.  Bytes not used by a specific element type are 
not guaranteed to be zero.
Note: PhotoElements are not protocol requests, but rather sub-packets within another protocol request (i.e. 
ExecuteImmediate, CreatePhotoflo, ModifyPhotoflo, or RedefinePhotoflo). 
Events
# of Bytes	Value	Description
1	CARD8	XIE event code
1	<varies>	<event-specific>
2	CARD16	sequence number
4	TIMESTAMP	time
24	<varies>	<event-specific>
Events consist of thirty-two (32) bytes.  The common fields (event code, sequence number, and time) 
are not included in XieEvn definitions.  Bytes not used by a specific event code are not guaranteed to 
be zero. 
Errors
# of Bytes	Value	Description
1	0	Error
1	CARD8	XIE error code
2	CARD16	sequence number
4	<varies>	<error-specific (often a resource-id)>
2	CARD16	minor opcode
1	CARD8	major opcode
21	<varies>	<error-specific>
Errors consist of thirty-two (32) bytes.  Bytes not used by the specific error code are not guaranteed to 
be zero.

Parameter Types
XIE and Core X Types
X Image Extension types are defined in this section.  All XIE parameters are defined as being either one of 
the extension types, or one of the core protocol types.  XIE makes use of the following core protocol types 
(defined in the X11 core protocol specification):
BITMAP	BOOL	CARD8	CARD16
CARD32	CHAR2B	COLORMAP	DRAWABLE
EVENT	GCONTEXT	INT8	INT16
INT32	PIXMAP	STRING8	TIMESTAMP
VISUAL	WINDOW	XID*
*  XID is used to refer to the core X11 type defined as the identifier for a resource.
Techniques
Several standard techniques are defined in this document.  Each is assigned a technique number and a de-
scriptive name string.  XIE can also be extended with private techniques that are implementation dependent.  
Private technique numbers are generated dynamically.  Private technique name strings include the name of 
the organization that defined the technique.  The organization name is encompassed by _ (underscore) 
characters.  Technique naming and numbering conventions are summarized in Table 3-1.

Table 3-1   Technique naming and numbering conventions
The technique number is supplied to pipeline elements to specify the desired technique.  Numbers for 
standard techniques can be hard-coded, whereas numbers for private techniques must be obtained using 
the QueryTechniques protocol request. 

For more information on techniques and a description of the techniques defined in this document, refer to Appendix A.  A 
list of techniques itemized by ServiceClass can be found in Appendix B.  Numbers assigned to standard techniques are encoded 
in Appendix C.
Definitions
XieTypAlignment
Alignment defines the valid pixel and scanline alignments allowed for image data transported through the 
protocol stream.  The server's Alignment attribute is returned by the QueryImageExtension protocol re-
quest.  
XieTypAlignment	{ XieValAlignable, XieValArbitrary }
*	Alignable	data units must fit evenly within a byte, or they must fill a byte, or fill a multiple
	of bytes (i.e. pixels may be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24*, or 32* bits in the protocol stream).
*	Arbitrary	data units may fall at any bit address (i.e. 10 bit packed pixels are acceptable in
	the protocol stream). 
*	XIE supports pixels up to sixteen (16) bits per band for both SingleBand and TripleBand data.  In addition, 
SingleBand data are supported up to the depth of the deepest DRAWABLE supported by the server.


XieTypArithmeticOp
ArithmeticOp defines the valid operations for the Arithmetic process element. 
XieTypArithmeticOp	{	XieValAdd,
	XieValSub, XieValSubRev,

	XieValMin, XieValMax,
	XieValGamma }
*	Add	src1 + src2	or  src1 + constant
*	Sub	src1 - src2	or  src1 - constant

*	NE		src1 ¹ src2	or  src1 ¹ constant
*	GT		src1 > src2	or  src1 > constant
*	GE		src1 ³ src2	or  src1 ³ constant


XieTypConstant
Constant is typically used to supply per-band constant values.  All constants are passed as floats.  When a 
constant is to be used as a substitute for a Constrained image pixel, the constant is rounded to the nearest 
integer, and then hard-clipped to the range of levels that applies to the pixel for which it is a substitute.  In 
most other cases the constant is used as is (i.e. as a float).

types of data (e.g. lookup table entries, rectangles, histogram counts, etc.) must be transported as one or 
more complete aggregates.  The status indicating the eventual end of data, is supplied in the associated 
protocol request or reply.  The interpretation of the data stream is determined by parameters specified to the 
PhotoElement accepting or generating the data.

]
Name-space identifies the execution domain used for a Photoflo.  Flo-id identifies a particular instance of a 
Photoflo.
For stored Photoflos name-space is always ServerIDSpace (the value zero) and flo-id is the Photo-
flo's resource-id.

ExportState is a status value returned from an ExportClient element in a reply to the corresponding 
GetClientData protocol request. 
XieTypExportState	{	XieValExportDone,

*	ExportError	an error condition prevents data availability

XieTypFloat
Float specifies data is in the IEEE single-precision format as described in ANSI/IEEE  Standard 754-1985, 
IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic.  Float is used only for constant parameter values, 
matrix coefficients, etc., but never for transported image data.  The byte order of each Float is dealt with in 
the same manner as other numeric values; it is determined at core protocol connection setup time.

XieTypInterleave
Interleave defines the way in which bands of TripleBand data may be interleaved. 
XieTypInterleave	{	XieValBandByPixel,
XieValBandByPlane }
*	BandByPixel	the data for all bands are interleaved on a per-pixel basis and transmitted as a single data plane 
(e.g. for RGB data red, green, and blue values for a given pixel are immediately followed by the 
red, green, and blue values for the next pixel). BandByPixel is similar to the core protocol 
ZPixmap format.
*	BandByPlane	the data for each band are transmitted as separate data planes (e.g. for RGB data all red data are 
transmitted in one plane, all green data in a separate plane, and all blue data in another plane).

Interleave is generally used in conjunction with Orientation, which would define the order of the interleaved bands.


XieTypLevels 
Levels describes the potential dynamic range for the quantization levels associated with each band of an 
image.

XieTypLUT
LUT is the type for the XIE server resource used to hold arrays which map one set of values to another. The 
arrays are one-dimensional, and the resource holds either one or three arrays.  The ImportClientLUT and 
ImportLUT elements are used to import LUT data into a Photoflo, the Point element uses the data, the

XieTypOrientation
Orientation defines the transmission order of image data units through the protocol stream.
XieTypOrientation	{	XieValLSFirst, XieValMSFirst }
Note: in the examples that follow, the order of bytes in the DataStream should be read from left to right.

encoded-order	Specifies the order of bits within bytes of encoded (compressed) data. 
Example:  showing 2 bytes (within each byte the first encoded bit is 0, last is bit 7)

LSFirst
MSFirst


76543210  76543210
01234567  01234567

fill-order	When multiple pixels are put in the same byte, or a pixel spans multiple bytes, fill-order 
specifies whether the pixels (or parts of a pixel) are packed into the most or least 
significant bits of a byte first.
Example:	showing 8 2-bit pixels (aa, bb, cc, etc.),  and 2 10-bit pixels: aaaaaaaaaa 
and bbbbbbbbbb)

LSFirst
MSFirst


ddccbbaa  hhggffee
aabbccdd  eeffgghh


aaaaaaaa  bbbbbbaa  xxxxbbbb
aaaaaaaa  aabbbbbb  bbbbxxxx

pixel-order	For pixels that span a byte boundary, pixel-order specifies whether the most or least 
significant bits of the pixel are put into the DataStream first.  Any pad bits that are 
present between pixels always follow the pixel data (i.e. pad bits are not considered to be 
either LS-bits or MS-bits of the pixel data).
Example: 	showing 2 10-bit pixels, each with 2 bits of pad  (within each pixel the LS-bits 
are 0 and a, the MS-bits are 9 and j, the pad bits are p)

band mentioned in the common name of the colorspace (e.g. red is the least significant 
band of RGB data).
	For BandByPixel data, band-order specifies whether this band is put in the least or most 
significant bits of a pixel.

LSFirst

protocol (levels, constants, etc.), the first element of the triplet  corresponds with the 
least significant band as defined above.
XieTypPhotoElement
PhotoElement, or just element, is a generic type used for import, process, or export elements in a Photoflo.  
The syntax of a generic element was described in Chapter 2.  The actual element definitions are found in 
Chapters 6, 7, and 8.

XieTypPhotoflo 
Photoflo is the type for the XIE server resource which is used to represent a sequence of image processing 
operations. Stored Photoflos are permanent resources. As such they must be created and destroyed by 
the client.
XieTypPhotoflo	XID
For immediate Photoflos, see type Photospace and the ExecuteImmediate protocol request.

XieTypPhotofloOutcome
PhotofloOutcome is returned by the PhotofloDone event and indicates the reason why the Photoflo left the 
Active state. 
XieTypPhotofloOutcome	{	XieValFloSuccess, 
XieValFloError, 
XieValFloAbort }
*	FloSuccess	the Photoflo completed normally
*	FloError	the Photoflo terminated due to an error condition
*	FloAbort	the Photoflo was aborted by the client


XieTypPhotofloState
PhotofloState identifies the current execution state of a Photoflo.
XieTypPhotofloState	{	XieValInactive, 
XieValActive, 
XieValNonexistent }
*	Inactive	the state of a stored Photoflo prior to execution, after an error or abort, or after execution 
completes. Inactive stored Photoflos can be modified and redefined.
*	Active	the state of a stored or immediate Photoflo during execution.
		A Photoflo remains Active until:
			- all export elements have finished their task, and
			- all data exported for the client have been retrieved, or
			- an error prevents further progress, or
			- the client issues an abort request.  
*	Nonexistent	the state of a Photoflo that does not exist (never existed or has been destroyed).

XieTypPhotomap
Photomap is the type for the XIE resource used to store image data in the server.  A Photomap is a per-
manent resource that can be created and destroyed by the client.  ImportPhotomap is used to import per-
manent image data into a Photoflo.  ExportPhotomap is used to (re)populate the resource. 
XieTypPhotomap	XID

XieTypPhotospace
Photospace is the type for the XIE resource used to define a XIE name space within which immediate 
Photoflos may be executed. A Photospace is a permanent resource and as such must be created and de-
stroyed  by the client. 
XieTypPhotospace	XID

XieTypPhototag
Phototag is the position or index of a PhotoElement within a list of elements used to specify a Photoflo. The 
first element in the list has a Phototag value of one (1).  A Phototag value of zero (0) is reserved for special 
purposes, such as indicating an optional element input that is not connected, or indicating Photoflo errors 
that are not specific to an element. 
XieTypPhototag		CARD16
XieTypProcessDomain
ProcessDomain is a sub-structure inserted in many PhotoElement definitions.  It is used to restrict the 
element's processing to a subset of the source data pixels.  A ProcessDomain can be either a list-of-
rectangles or a control-plane. 
XieTypProcessDomain
[	offset-x	INT32
offset-y	INT32
domain	XieTypPhototag
]
Offset-x and offset-y specifies the spatial registration between the element's data source(s) and the 
ProcessDomain (i.e. offset relative to the origin of the source(s)).  Domain is the Phototag of the element 
providing the ProcessDomain data.
If the value zero (0) is specified for domain, processing is not restricted by the processing domain, other-
wise, domain references an element outputting a list-of-rectangles or image data which is used as a control-
plane. 
If domain is a list-of-rectangles, processing is restricted to the intersection of the data source(s) and any 
rectangle within the list (offset-x and offset-y are added to the x and y of each rectangle). 
If domain is a source of Constrained, SingleBand, bi-level image data (i.e. a control-plane), processing is 
restricted to the intersection of the data source(s) and non-zero locations within domain. 
ProcessDomain is not supported by DIS but is included in the subset because the Point element takes a 
ProcessDomain as a parameter (in this case domain must be zero). 

XieTypRectangle
Rectangle describes a rectangle used in XieTypROI. 
XieTypRectangle
[	x	INT32
y	INT32
width	CARD32
height	CARD32
]
X and y are the coordinates of the upper left hand corner of the rectangle within the ProcessDomain (the 
domain's x,y offset is also added to these coordinates to position the rectangle relative to the image being 
processed).  Width and height are the extent of the rectangle.

XieTypROI
ROI (Rectangles-Of-Interest) is the XIE resource used to contain a list-of-rectangles (input for a 
ProcessDomain).  A ROI resource is a permanent resource and as such must be created and destroyed by 
the client.  ImportClientROI and ImportROI elements are used to import a list-of-rectangles into a Photoflo, 
the ExportROI element is used to (re)populate an ROI resource, and the ExportClientROI element is 
provided to facilitate sending rectangles back to the client *.
XieTypROI	XID
*	The list-of-rectangles that can be retrieved by the client need not be identical to the original list that was received from 
the client, but it must be logically equivalent.
XieTypServiceClass
ServiceClass defines the recognized image processing service sets supported by this X Image Extension 
standard.
XieTypServiceClass	{ XieValFull, XieValDIS }
*	Full	supports the entire XIE protocol as defined in this document
*	DIS	supports the Document Image Subset, a proper subset of Full XIE
An itemized list of XIE types, techniques, protocol requests, elements, events, and errors that are included in each 
ServiceClass can be found in Appendix B.

Techniques protocol request.
XieTypTechniqueRec
[	needs-parameters	BOOL

Needs-parameters indicates that a technique requires additional parameters; or if false, the technique either 
takes no parameters, or its parameters are optional.  Group identifies which group the technique belongs to.  
Number is the numeric identifier assigned to the technique *.  Speed represents the server's view of the 
speed of this technique relative to the other techniques in the same group (0 is the slowest, and 255 is the 
fastest).  Name is the XIE compliant technique name string.
* Numbers assigned to standard techniques are encoded in Appendix C.

Protocol Parameter Types   3-1

Resources
Overview
XIE resources are extension server objects created by the client which contain information used by the 
extension in carrying out various protocol requests.  There are protocol requests to create and destroy 
each resource type.  Resource identifiers are generated by the client as defined by the core protocol.  
All XIE resources are reference counted. 
Binding Resources to Photoflos
Each resource that is referenced from a Photoflo is bound to the Photoflo (and its reference count is 
incremented) when the Photoflo becomes Active. 
ColorList resources
A ColorList is purged of previous allocations when a Photoflo begins execution, and is populated with 
new allocations (via ConvertToIndex) as the Photoflo proceeds.  A ColorList can only be referenced by 
one Active Photoflo at a time.  The ColorList's reference count is decremented when the Photoflo is no 
longer Active. 
LUT, Photomap, and ROI resources
These XIE resources consist of two parts: one part contains the resource-id, the other part holds at-
tributes and data.  Figure 4-1 pictures the first part as a handle, and the second part as a bucket.  Upon 
resource creation only the handle exists.  The bucket is created when the Photoflo (referencing the 
handle via an ExportResource element) becomes Active.  The handle and bucket are joined when 
the Photoflo successfully completes.  Conceptually each part contains a separate reference count.
 
Figure 4-1   Creating and populating a new Photomap
In the case of ImportResource elements the handle and bucket are both bound to the Photoflo 
when it first becomes Active (initialization).  For ExportResource elements, only the handle is 
bound at this time and a new bucket is created to hold the forthcoming data.  This bucket's attributes 
are derived from the ExportResource element.
If an export handle is already connected to a bucket, the old bucket remains with its handle until suc-
cessful Photoflo completion.  Thus, the old bucket is preserved if the Photoflo terminates due to an error 
condition or if an Abort request is received from the client.  
The new bucket is filled with data as the Photoflo proceeds.  When the Photoflo successfully com-
pletes, old buckets can be freed if they have no other references, and the waiting handle is joined to the 
new bucket.  This is illustrated in figure 4-2.
 
Figure 4-2   Process image from Photomap a, place result into Photomap b
This model also allows pseudo in-place operations such as is illustrated in figure 4-3.  Here an image is 
imported from a Photomap, processed, and then the result is exported back to the same Photomap.  Note 
that upon completion the old handle is moved to the new bucket and the old bucket is destroyed.

Resource destruction
When a destroy request is received the resource-id is immediately disassociated from the resource and 
the resource's reference count(s) is(are) decremented.  For each reference count that goes to zero, the 
associated resources are freed (e.g. memory or colors). 
Synchronizing resource access
If multiple Photoflos reference the same resource, the client must synchronize access to the resource 
(e.g. Await completion of the Photoflo writing the resource before beginning execution of a Photoflo 
reading from the resource).  Core resources can be volatile, requiring the client to maintain the data 
integrity of the resource while the Photoflo is active.

QueryImageExtension returns information about the XIE server's capabilities.  Each client should use 
QueryImageExtension to establish version compatibility between client and server prior to making any 
other XIE request.  If a client fails to first establish the desired version using QueryImageExtension, the 
behavior of other requests is undefined (which generally means that the server will use the version 
number of its own choice). 
Client-major-version and client-minor-version specify which version of the XIE protocol the client 
would like to use.  If the client can support multiple versions, the highest version should be given. 
The server-major-version and server-minor-version specify the version of the XIE protocol that the 
server expects from the client. If the server supports the version requested by the client, this version 
number will be returned.  If the client has requested a higher version than is supported by the server, 
the server's highest version will be returned.  Otherwise, if the client has requested a lower version than 
is supported by the server, the server's lowest version will be returned.  It is the client's responsibility to 
decide whether or not it can match the server's version of the protocol. 
Service-class specifies the ServiceClass supported by the XIE server .  Alignment specifies the image 
data alignment restrictions of the server (i.e. the alignment of pixels  and scanlines). 
The following parameters convey the approximate range and granularity of Unconstrained data in the 
XIE server.  For servers that represent Unconstrained data using floating point, unconstrained-
mantissa returns the number of bits in the server's floating point format (including the sign bit).  If the 
server uses fixed point, unconstrained-mantissa is 0.  Unconstrained-max-exp returns the largest value 
n such that 2n - 1 is representable in the server's Unconstrained data format.  Unconstrained-min-exp 
returns the smallest (most negative) value n such that 2n is representable in the server's Unconstrained 
data format.
Constrained-levels provides a hint about how the XIE server might process Constrained data most 
efficiently.  Constrained-levels returns a list of levels that are recommended for Constrained data by 
the server.  (a value of 0 means 232 levels).

QueryTechniques returns information about the standard and private techniques that are supported by 
the server.  The server may be queried for All techniques, all Default techniques, or a group of 
techniques that are functionally similar (e.g. all Geometry techniques). 
Technique-group specifies the group of techniques for which the server is to return information. 
Technique-information is a list of TechniqueRec entries which are returned in arbitrary order.  Each 
entry contains the following information:
needs-parameters	if true, indicates that the technique requires additional parameters; if 
false, the technique takes no parameters, or it has parameters that are 
optional.  If parameters are optional, they must be totally omitted, or 
they must all be supplied.
group 	identifies which group the technique belongs to.  
number	the numeric identifier assigned to the technique (MS bit is zero for 
standard techniques, or one for private techniques).
speed	the server's assessment of the speed of this technique relative to other 
techniques in the same group (0 :== slowest, 255 :== fastest).  
name	the XIE compliant technique name string of the form:
  <STANDARD-TECHNIQUE-NAME> or
_<ORGANIZATION-NAME>_<PRIVATE-TECHNIQUE-NAME>
The technique number is supplied to pipeline elements to specify a desired algorithm or technique.  
While numbers for standard techniques can be hard-coded (e.g. defined in an include file), numbers for 
private techniques must be obtained using the QueryTechniques protocol request prior to their use.

ColorList
CreateColorList
XieReqCreateColorList
color-list	XieTypColorList
Errors:	Alloc, IDChoice
Events:	none
CreateColorList creates an unpopulated server resource which can be used to store the list of colors 
allocated by a ConvertToIndex element.  The COLORMAP allocations that are recorded in a ColorList 
belong to the client that executed the Photoflo that populated the resource (this is not necessarily the 
same client that created the ColorList).  A ColorList cannot be the target of more than one Active 
Photoflo at a time.
Color-list is the client supplied ColorList identifier to be assigned to this resource. 
Color-list is populated (or re-populated) with new COLORMAP allocations via a ConvertToIndex 
element as the Photoflo executes.  The contents of color-list may be queried using QueryColorList. 
The client may explicitly purge all allocated cells from color-list using PurgeColorList.  The client may 
cause an implicit deallocation of cells from color-list by making it the target of a Photoflo and com-
mencing its execution.  An implicit purge also takes place if the COLORMAP referenced by color-list is 
freed or if the client that owns the cells exits (i.e. the client that populated color-list).
Color-list can be destroyed using DestroyColorList.

Errors:	Alloc, ColorList
Events:	none
QueryColorList returns a list of colors allocated by a ConvertToIndex element. 
Color-list is the ColorList resource to be queried. 
Colormap is the COLORMAP from which the colors were allocated.  Colors is the list of allocated 
COLORMAP indices. 
When there are no colors in color-list, the value zero (0) is returned for colormap, and the list of colors 
is of length zero. 
Error	Cause
Alloc	insufficient resources
ColorList	invalid color-list
Notes:
*	The COLORMAP was originally supplied by the client as a ConvertToIndex parameter.
*	The returned colors are owned by the server, and therefore, should not be freed via core X protocol requests (e.g. 
FreeColors)
*	The allocated colors can be freed by:
	- issuing a PurgeColorList or DestroyColorList request,
	- commencing execution of a Photoflo that targets color-list,
	- freeing colormap,
	- shutting down the client that populated color-list.


LUT
CreateLUT

CreateLUT creates a server resource which is used as a lookup table by the Point element.  A lookup 
table consists of one or three single dimension arrays, each long enough to contain an entry for all 
possible pixels values in the image data to which the Point element will be applied. 
Lut is the client supplied LUT identifier to be assigned to this resource. 
The LUT is populated (or re-populated) with lookup table entries after the successful execution of a 
Photoflo containing an ExportLUT element which targets lut.  Lookup table data can be imported into a 
Photoflo using an ImportLUT element. These data can be used by Point, and they can be exported to 
the client with the aid of an ExportClientLUT element.
Lut can be destroyed using DestroyLUT. 
Error	Cause
Alloc	insufficient resources
IDChoice	invalid lut
A LUT can be populated with a simple ExecuteImmediate( ImportClientLUT, ExportLUT ) Photoflo.  
PutClientData is then used to transport the lookup table entries.  See ImportClientLUT and Point for further 
information on LUTs

CreatePhotomap creates a server resource which is used to store image data.  Photomap data may be 
rendered for display or used as input to control or modify the rendition of another image. 
Photomap is the client supplied Photomap identifier to be assigned to this resource. 
Photomap attributes are defined when a Photoflo containing an ExportPhotomap element populates 
photomap with data. 
The Photomap is populated (or re-populated) with image data after the successful execution of a Pho-
toflo containing an ExportPhotomap element that targets photomap.  Photomap data can be imported 
into a Photoflo for rendition or control purposes using an ImportPhotomap element. It can also be 
exported back to the client with the aid of an ExportClientPhoto element.  Photomap attributes can be 
queried using QueryPhotomap.  Photomap can be destroyed using DestroyPhotomap. 
Error	Cause
Alloc	insufficient resources
IDChoice	invalid photomap
A Photomap can be populated with a simple ExecuteImmediate(ImportClientPhoto, ExportPhotomap) 
Photoflo.  PutClientData is then used to transport the image data.  See ImportClientPhoto and ExportPhotomap 
and their associated techniques for more information regarding the format of image data.

QueryPhotomap returns the queriable attributes of a Photomap. 
Photomap is the Photomap to be queried. 
Populated is a Boolean that indicates that photomap has been populated with attributes and data.  If 
populated is false, all remaining fields contain zeros.  Data-type shows whether the number of quan-
tization levels is valid (Constrained) or unknown (Unconstrained).  Data-class is the class of image 
data (i.e. SingleBand or TripleBand).  Width and height are the dimensions of the image data in pixels 
(per band).  Levels is the potential dynamic range, or number of quantization levels (per band).  Decode 
is the DecodeTechnique that will be required to interpret or decompress the data.
If data-type is  Unconstrained, the returned values for levels are zeros.  If data-class is SingleBand, 
width, height, and levels for unused bands are returned as zeros.

ROI
CreateROI
XieReqCreateROI
roi	XieTypROI
Errors:	Alloc, IDChoice
Events:	none
CreateROI creates a server ROI (Rectangles-Of-Interest) resource.  A ROI resource may be imported 
into a Photoflo and used in conjunction with a ProcessDomain specification to restrict processing to a 
subset of image data.  The ROI, when populated, will contain a list-of-rectangles (of type Rectangle).  
Roi is the client supplied ROI identifier to be assigned to this resource. 
The ROI is populated (or re-populated) with a list-of-rectangles after the successful execution of a 
Photoflo containing an ExportROI element which targets roi.  An ROI resource does not have any 
queriable attributes.  
ROI data can be imported into a Photoflo using an ImportROI element.  This data, which is  used by 
several of the PhotoElements defined in chapters 7 and 8, can also be exported back to the client with 
the aid of an ExportClientROI element.
Roi can be destroyed using DestroyROI. 
Error	Cause
Alloc	insufficient resources
IDChoice	invalid roi
An ROI can be populated with a simple ExecuteImmediate ( ImportClientROI, ExportROI ) Photoflo.  
PutClientData is then used to transport the list-of-rectangles. 
If the client uses ExportClientROI to retrieve a list-of-rectangles from the server, the number of rectangles and the 
content of the list that is returned may differ from original list that was obtained from the client, but its contents will 
be logically equivalent.

Pipelined Processing
What is a Photoflo?
A Photoflo is a directed acyclic graph. Each node has zero or more input connections, and zero or one 
output connection.  A node specifies the source for an input by identifying another upstream node.  A 
node's output connection can be used as a source for any number of downstream input connections.  A 
Photoflo is permitted to have taps and multiple final destinations.
The protocol representation of a Photoflo is a list of elements.  Since the entire list is sent to the server 
as a single protocol request, the total length of the list, including its protocol header, must fit within a 
maximum size protocol message (see, maximum-request-length, established by X11 connection setup).
Each element of the Photoflo is identified by its position in the list. This position, or index, is called a 
Phototag.  The first element in the list is index one (1).  The order of elements in the list does not have to 
match the Photoflo topology because there is no implicit coupling of output N to input N+1.  The 
source for each element's input connections are explicitly specified using the Phototags of upstream 
elements.
There are three types of elements.  Import elements bring data into the Photoflo from external resources 
or the client, have one output connection, and no input connections.  Process elements perform some 
operation on the data (e.g. convolution), have one or more input connections, and exactly one output 
connection.  Export elements emit data from the Photoflo to external resources or to the client, have one 
input connection, and no output connections.  A Photoflo should include at least one import element 
and one export element to be useful.

Figure 5-1   Photoflo element input and output connections
All data external to the Photoflo (internal server data and client data), are accessed through import and 
export elements.  Therefore, for purposes of Photoflo definition and modification, X and XIE resource-
ids are considered element parameters rather than element sources or destinations. No element is 
permitted to reference a Photoflo for any reason.  It is also an error to specify an export element as an 
input to any element.
Figure 5-2 illustrates several capabilities of Photoflo construction.  An RGB image is imported from the 
client.  This image is saved in a Photomap for later re-use.  The blue band is selected and translated (to 
correct registration).  This result is exported back to the client.  A BandCombine element associates a 
single band imported from a Photomap (the red band), with the green band selected from the initial RGB 
image, and the re-registered blue band.  The combined image is then converted to index data and 
exported to a PIXMAP and to a WINDOW.  The color allocation results are saved in a ColorList. 
 
Figure 5-2   Example Photoflo
Two kinds of Photoflos
There are stored Photoflos and immediate Photoflos.  Stored Photoflos persist beyond execu-
tion and may be modified or totally redefined prior to subsequent executions. Immediate Photoflos 
are ephemeral - a single protocol request defines and begins its execution, then it is automatically 
destroyed upon completion.  Services common to both types of Photoflos are:
*	event notification
*	error notification
*	put data: send data from the client into a Photoflo
*	get data: return data exported from a Photoflo back to the client
*	query: return information about the Photoflo
*	await: block future client requests until the Photoflo completes
*	abort: terminate Photoflo execution prematurely
Multi-client Photoflos
A stored Photoflo can be executed by a client other than the client that created it.  It is also possible 
that the Photoflo may reference resources that belong to other clients, and data may be supplied and 
retrieved by various clients.  The following rules apply when multiple clients are involved in the execu-
tion of a Photoflo:
*	errors that stem from executing Photoflo elements are sent to the client executing the Photoflo,
*	errors that stem from executing client data put or get requests go to the client executing the request,
*	colors recorded in a ColorList resource belong to the client executing the Photoflo,
*	PhotofloDone events are sent to the client executing the Photoflo,
*	multiple clients can Await completion of a given Photoflo.
Photoflo States
Stored Photoflos enter the Inactive state upon creation and transition to the Active state when exe-
cution is requested.  Immediate Photoflos are both created and made Active by the execute request.  
A Photoflo remains Active until: all ImportClient elements have received a final flag, all export 
elements have finished their task, and all data exported for the client have been retrieved, or an error 
prevents further progress, or the client issues an Abort request.  After execution stored Photoflos 
return to the Inactive state, whereas immediate Photoflos are destroyed (become Nonexistent). The 
client may destroy a stored Photoflo at any time.

Flo'ing Data to a Resource
Besides image rendition and display, immediate or stored Photoflos are also used to populate XIE 
resources with data and attributes.  Some form of processing may be applied to the data, but in the 
simplest case, a two element import/export Photoflo is generally sufficient. 
Also all types of ephemeral client data may be imported and used directly by a Photoflo, without the 
necessity of first storing it in an XIE resource.  For example, simple transport of an image (compressed 
or uncompressed) to a WINDOW is expected.

Name space
For requests that only apply to stored Photoflos (Create, Modify, Redefine, Execute, and Destroy), 
the Photoflo is identified solely by its resource-id.  For all other requests, events, and errors that ref-
erence a Photoflo, the Photoflo is identified using type Executable, which is a tupple identifying the 
name-space and flo-id of the Photoflo.
Name-space for stored Photoflos is always ServerIDSpace (the value zero), and flo-id is the 
Photoflo's resource-id. 
Name-space for immediate Photoflos is a Photospace resource-id, and flo-id  is a thirty-two (32) bit 
value that uniquely identifies the instance of this Photoflo. 
CreatePhotospace

ExecuteImmediate defines and begins execution of an immediate Photoflo.  Execution is asyn-
chronous.  The Photoflo is destroyed after execution completes and all data exported for the client have 
been retrieved.  It is legal to have multiple unique instances of immediate Photoflos (and stored 
Photoflos) Active concurrently.
Instance specifies the Photospace/flo-id tupple by which this Photoflo will be identified in other re-
quests, events, or errors.  Notify specifies whether a PhotofloDone event should be sent upon comple-
tion.  Element-list defines the import, process, and export elements to be executed.
If any clients have blocked themselves during the execution of the Photoflo (see Await), they will be-
come unblocked when photoflo's state changes from Active to Nonexistent.  If notify is true, a Photo-
floDone event is also generated by this transition.  Finally, this instance is destroyed.

Stored Photoflos
The following requests are used to: create, modify, redefine, execute, and destroy stored Photoflos.  
In these requests the Photoflo instance is identified only by its resource-id.  However, errors and events 
generated due to these requests identify the instance using type Executable (the name-space is 
ServerIDSpace and the flo-id is the Photoflo's resource-id).

CreatePhotoflo creates a stored Photoflo resource, defines its complete contents, and sets it in the 
Inactive state.
Photoflo is a new resource-id by which this Photoflo will be identified in other requests, events, or er-
rors.  Element-list defines the import, process, and export elements to be stored for execution. 
Although resources and parameters are specified at creation, no action is taken to validate them at that 
time.  CreatePhotoflo will only store the Photoflo's definition and parameter validation is delayed until 
an execute request is received.

Errors:	Photoflo, FloAccess, FloAlloc
Events:	PhotofloDone
ExecutePhotoflo changes a stored Photoflo to the Active state.  Execution is asynchronous.  The 
Photoflo returns to the Inactive state when execution completes and all data exported for the client have 
been retrieved.  It is legal to have multiple stored Photoflos (and immediate Photoflos) Active 
concurrently.
Photoflo is the Photoflo to be executed.  Notify specifies whether a PhotofloDone event should be sent 
upon completion.
Conceptually, Photoflo execution is broken into at least three phases :
1.	Initialization:
a.	the Photoflo state is set Active,
b.	bind external inputs (XIE reference counts are incremented)
c.	imported attributes are propagated downstream
d.	attributes and element parameter values are validated
e.	lookup external destinations 
f.	create receptors for data to be exported to XIE resources2
2.	Execution:
a.	data from server resources, if any, is pulled into the Photoflo
b.	data from the client, if any, is pushed into the Photoflo (PutClientData)
c.	processed data is exported to server resources as required2
d.	processed data is made available for client retrieval (GetClientData) 
3.	Completion:
a.	unbind external inputs
b.	join exported data with associated XIE resources2 and unbind remaining resources
c.	report any error that occurred
d.	if notify is true, send a PhotofloDone event
e.	if Await has been requested, un-block client execution

If an error occurs during any phase, the client is notified and the Photoflo is terminated.  Other events 
can be sent by individual elements, as specified in their descriptions.

ModifyPhotoflo allows element parameters of a stored Photoflo to be modified.
Photoflo is the Photoflo to be modified.  Start specifies the Phototag where element replacement is to 
begin.  Element-list is a sequential list of elements which will replace existing elements. 
ModifyPhotoflo allows parameter modification only.  No topological changes are allowed.  Elements 
cannot be deleted, inserted, or appended.

Multiple ModifyPhotoflo requests can be sent in order to  edit individual elements, but, for greater efficiency and 
particularly when repetitive modify/execute requests are expected, elements can be grouped such that a single 
ModifyPhotoflo can perform multiple element modifications.

RedefinePhotoflo allows all elements of a stored Photoflo to be removed and replaced with a new list.  
There are no restrictions on changing element types, Phototag sources, or the list's size.
Photoflo is the Photoflo to be redefined.  Element-list is a sequential list of elements which will replace 
all existing elements.

RedefinePhotoflo may be considered a hint that the new list of  elements is in some way similar to those being 
replaced. RedefinePhotoflo can also be used as a means to conserve resource-ids. 
Sending Data to the Server

XieReqPutClientData
instance	XieTypExecutable
element	XieTypPhototag
final	BOOL
band-number	CARD8
data	XieTypDataStream
Errors:	FloAlloc, FloAccess, FloID, FloElement, FloValue
Events:	none
PutClientData sends a stream of data to an Active Photoflo.  Since the complete data object may be 
larger than can fit in a single protocol request, XIE allows the stream to be segmented; the last segment 
is signaled with a final flag. 
Instance and element identify the Photoflo and specific ImportClient element to receive the data.  
Final specifies that this is the last (or only) segment of data to be sent. 
If element is a band oriented element, band-number specifies which client band of data is being sent 
(interleave and band-order specified for the ImportClient element or technique determine how cli-
ent bands are mapped to server bands). 
Data is a counted list of bytes that comprises the data stream.  The organization and contents of the 
stream must match the parameters given to the ImportClient element or the results are undefined.
An arbitrary amount of image data can be sent per request, whereas for non-image data one or more 
complete aggregates must be sent per request (e.g. one or more LUT array entries).
If too many data are sent (e.g. too many rectangles, or too many scanlines), the unwanted data are 
discarded.  It is an error, however, to send too few data prior to signaling final. 
Error	Cause
FloAlloc	insufficient resources
FloAccess	Executable instance not Active
FloID	invalid Executable instance
FloElement	invalid Phototag or element-type specified by element
FloValue	invalid band-number 
for non-image data, data contains a partial aggregate
All types of client data (list-of-rectangles, lookup tables, and images) are transported to the server using 
PutClientData.  Tiled images can be transported using multiple ImportClientPhoto elements, which in turn feed a 
PasteUp element.

new-state	XieTypExportState
data	XieTypDataStream
Errors:	FloAlloc, FloAccess, FloID, FloElement, FloValue
Events:	none
GetClientData retrieves data from an ExportClient element within an Active Photoflo.  Data are 
returned in a contiguous read-once byte stream, which can be requested in segments that are limited in 
size by the amount the client desires or the amount available.  The format of the data depends on the pa-
rameters given to the ExportClient element from which the data are requested. 
Instance and element identify the Photoflo and specific ExportClient element from which to re-
trieve data.  Max-bytes specifies the maximum number of data bytes that can be sent to the client.  
Terminate is a Boolean that can be used to indicate that no more data are wanted after this request has 
been satisfied.  Band-number specifies which client band is to be retrieved  (interleave and band-order 
parameters specified for the ExportClient element technique determine how server bands are 
mapped to client bands).
New-state indicates the data availability status of the ExportClient element after satisfying the cur-
rent request.  Data is the counted list of bytes that is returned. 
If terminate is true, new-state will be ExportDone (the ExportClient element will discard any 
remaining data and stop producing additional data). 
If new-state is ExportEmpty and notify (for the ExportClient element) was specified as NewData, 
another ExportAvailable event will be sent when additional data become availabile.
If the request is sent to an ExportClient element that either: does not have any data, was termi-
nated by a previous GetClientData request, or has already returned all its data (ExportDone sent), the 
request will return a zero length data stream. 
Image data are always retrieved from the server as a byte stream, whereas non-image data are always 
returned by the server as one or more complete aggregates (i.e. max-bytes is effectively rounded down 
by the server to the match the nearest aggregate size).

Error	Cause
FloAlloc	insufficient resources
FloAccess	Executable instance not Active
FloID	invalid Executable instance
FloElement	invalid Phototag or element-type specified by element
FloValue	invalid band-number
Servers are required to buffer a non-zero amount of data per ExportClient element.  Beyond that point execution 
may be suspended until the client retrieves sufficient data. 
Terminate may be used to prematurely terminate output from an ExportClient element.  If terminate is not used, 
all data produced by the ExportClient element must be retrieved before the Photoflo can leave the Active state.

QueryPhotoflo will return the current status of a Photoflo.
Instance identifies the Photoflo that is being queried.
State indicates the state of the Photoflo.  Data-expected is a list of ImportClient elements that are 
expecting data from the protocol stream.  Data-available is a list of ExportClient elements from 
which data for the protocol stream are available.  Either or both of these lists may be of length zero. 
Specifying an unknown or invalid instance will result in a reply state of nonexistent and zero length 
data-expected and data-available lists. 
Error	Cause
FloAlloc	insufficient resources


Synchronization
Await
XieReqAwait
instance	XieTypExecutable
Errors:	FloAlloc
Events:	none
Await blocks all further requests for this client connection from being honored by the server while the 
Photoflo is Active.  When the Photoflo transitions from the Active state, blocked requests are allowed 
to be processed in the order received. 
Instance identifies the Active Photoflo which is to block requests from the client issuing the Await.
If instance is invalid or the Photoflo is not Active no action is taken; it is not an error, and the client is 
not blocked. 
Error	Cause
FloAlloc	insufficient resources
If a Photoflo has no ExportClient elements, the client can call Await.  If a Photoflo has exactly one 
ExportClient element, the client can just read bytes or be event-driven.  If a Photoflo has multiple 
ExportClient elements, the client should be event-driven.
Warning:	calling Await before sending all import data (including a final flag) or before retrieving all export 
data, will block the client from sending or retrieving the remaining data.  This will also prevent completion 
of the Photoflo and prevent any and all protocol requests from this client from being honored.  This 
deadlock can only be broken by another client completing or  aborting the Photoflo (to release the Await), 
or by breaking the client connection.

Termination
Abort
XieReqAbort
instance	XieTypExecutable
Errors:	none
Events:	none
Abort will prematurely terminate execution of a Photoflo.
Instance identifies the Photoflo which is to be aborted.
Any output from the Photoflo that is pending client retrieval is freed.  If instance is a stored Photoflo 
it will return to the Inactive state.  Immediate Photoflos are destroyed. 
If instance is invalid or the Photoflo is not Active no action is taken; it is not an error, and nothing is 
destroyed. 

 	Optimization, an additional phase, would be roughly associated with the initialization phase.
 	For LUT, Photomap, and ROI resources refer to page 4-1 Binding Resources to Photoflos.
 	Completion is contingent upon all such data being retrieved by the client.

Import Elements
Overview
Element categories
Import elements are used to bring external image data into a Photoflo.  Import elements have no Pho-
totag sources and have one output connection.  There are two types of import elements:
*	ImportResource	elements obtain data from a server resource (DRAWABLE, LUT, Photomap, or ROI).
*	ImportClient	elements require data from the client.  This data is transported to the server via the 
PutClientData protocol request.
Multi-source images
Multiple source images (e.g. tiled images, multi-client transport, ...) require a separate import element to 
describe each segment of the image.  The composite image can then be assembled using process ele-
ments (e.g. BandCombine, Blend, and PasteUp).
Events generated
Certain import elements can generate events to notify the client about abnormal behavior.  Two such 
events are defined:
*	DecodeNotify	notifies the client when anomalies are encountered while decoding a compressed image.  
It can also be returned if less data are sent than are required to complete an uncom-
pressed image.
*	ImportObscured	notifies the client that one or more regions to be imported from a WINDOW are 
obscured and unavailable from BACKINGSTORE.
Import from Client
ImportClient elements require data from the client.   Element parameters fully specify all the at-
tributes of the client data and describe the format or organization the data will have as it is transported 
through the protocol stream.  Data is sent to the ImportClient element via the PutClientData 
protocol request after the Photoflo becomes Active. 


ImportClientLUT
XieFloImportClientLUT
class	XieTypDataClass
band-order	XieTypOrientation
length	XieTypTripletofCARD32
levels	XieTypLevels
Errors:	FloAlloc, FloMatch, FloValue
Events:	none
ImportClientLUT accepts lookup table data from the protocol stream.  The transport of data through 
the protocol stream is accomplished using PutClientData. These data are accepted by the Point, Ex-
portLUT, and ExportClientLUT elements. 
Class indicates the number of lookup arrays to expect.  Length specifies the number of entries per array.  
Levels is the number of quantization levels represented per array.  Band-order declares the order of 
TripleBand arrays, or the order in which pixels from a TripleBand image should be combined to form 
indices for a SingleBand array .
The length of each array should match the number of source image levels that will be re-mapped 
through the array.  When a TripleBand image is to be re-mapped through a SingleBand array, the 
length of the array should match the product of the source image levels of all three bands1. Table 6-1 
summarizes the class of output data to expect from Point, based on the class of LUT and the class of 
image provided to Point. 
Table 6-1   Relationship between LUT class and image class
LUT class
Source image: SingleBand
Source image: TripleBand

SingleBand
( 1 array )
Output image: SingleBand
the single image band is re-
mapped through the single array
Usage examples:
achromatic --> achromatic
achromatic --> index
Output image: SingleBand
pixels from each image band are combined1 and 
then re-mapped through the single array
Usage examples:
trichromatic --> index
trichromatic --> achromatic

TripleBand
( 3 arrays )
Output image: TripleBand
the single image band is re-
mapped through each array sepa-
rately
Usage examples:
achromatic --> false-color
index----------> trichromatic
Output image: TripleBand
each image band is re-mapped through the 
corresponding array
Usage examples:
trichromatic --> trichromatic

The size of each array entry is either 1, 2, or 4 bytes; the smallest size into which the output quantization 
levels can be stored.  When array entries require multiple bytes, the byte order per entry is determined 
in the same manner as other numeric data: it is the byte orientation established at core X connection 
setup time. 
Error	Cause
FloAlloc	insufficient resources
FloMatch	levels is incompatible with the server's depth handling capabilities
FloValue	invalid class or band-order
When the client targets data at ImportClientLUT, one or more complete array entries must be sent per protocol 
request (see PutClientData).

ImportClientPhoto accepts image data from the protocol stream.  This data may be processed for 
display or used as ProcessDomain data.  The attributes and organization of the expected data stream 
are fully specified by the parameters.  The actual transport of image data through the protocol stream is 
requested using the PutClientData protocol request. 
Notify enables DecodeNotify events to be sent if anomalies are encountered while interpreting the 
imported image data (see DecodeNotify and DecodeTechnique descriptions).  Class specifies the 
DataClass of the data being imported.  Width and height are the  per-band image dimensions in pixels.  
Levels is the number of quantization levels per band.  Decode is the DecodeTechnique that will be 
required to decompress the image.  Decode-params is the list of additional parameters required by 
decode.
Only Constrained data can be sent through the protocol stream, therefore, levels must be valid.
Error	Cause
FloAlloc	insufficient resources
FloMatch	levels is incompatible with the server's depth handling capabilities
FloValue	invalid width, height, levels (zero)
invalid class
FloTechnique	invalid decode technique or decode-params
If the imported client data is compressed, ImportClientPhoto is generally responsible for decoding the data prior to 
forwarding the data to downstream elements.  An exception to this would be when an export element is a direct 
recipient of the data and the element desires data that are encoded using the same technique as decode. 
If individual bands of TripleBand data have different widths or heights (e.g. down-sampled YCbCr data), it is generally 
the client's responsibility to make inter-band dimensions match to render the image (e.g. use Geometry with 
appropriate band-mask and sample technique).  The JPEGBaseline technique that is described in Appendix A, includes 
a Boolean flag that allows an image that is interleaved BandByPixel to be up-sampled as part of the decode function.
All data and a final indication must be sent for each band before the Photoflo can leave the Active state.  The input 
data are sent by the client using the PutClientData protocol request.  If a subset of client bands are desired, the bands 
should be imported as individual SingleBand images. 


ImportClientROI
XieFloImportClientROI
rectangles	CARD32	
Errors:	FloAlloc
Events:	none
ImportClientROI accepts a list-of-rectangles from the protocol stream.  These data can be used as 
input to a ProcessDomain or an ExportROI or ExportClientROI element.  The actual transport of data 
through the protocol stream is accomplished using the PutClientData protocol request (the band-
number parameter of PutClientData is ignored).
Rectangles specifies the number of rectangles expected. 
Each rectangle is described using numeric values (see Rectangle), as such, the byte order of such data 
is determined at core protocol connection setup time.
Error	Cause
FloAlloc	insufficient resources
When the client targets data at ImportClientROI, one or more complete Rectangles must be sent per protocol 
request (see PutClientData).


Import from Resource
ImportResource elements obtain data from server resources: core DRAWABLEs, and XIE LUT, Pho-
tomap, and ROI resources. 
The attributes and data of XIE resources are bound to ImportResource elements when the Photoflo 
becomes Active.  The same resource may also be the target of an ExportResource element in the 
same Photoflo.  However, the association between the resource's identifier (XID) and the new attributes 
and data does not occur until the Photoflo successfully completes (i.e. leaves the Active state).   (See 
Binding Resources to Photoflos in Chapter 4.)

ImportDrawable allows access to data existing in a DRAWABLE.  This data may be processed for 
display or, if drawable is a BITMAP, used as ProcessDomain data.  
Notify enables ImportObscured events to be sent if data for one or more regions of a WINDOW are 
obscured and unavailable from BACKINGSTORE (see ImportObscured).  Drawable is the DRAWABLE 
resource supplying the data.  Src-x, src-y, width, and height specify the region of data to be imported 
from drawable.  Fill is the COLORMAP index to use for all regions that are obscured. 
Error	Cause
FloAlloc	insufficient resources
FloDrawable	invalid drawable
FloValue	invalid region (src-x, src-y, width, height)
The data are imported as ZPixmap format COLORMAP indices (i.e. SingleBand index data).  Index data are 
appropriate for only a few process elements (e.g. where a nearest-neighbor technique is used).  ConvertFromIndex 
can be used to convert index data prior to feeding it to other process elements.  Compare can also be used to produce 
bitonal data from index data.

ImportDrawablePlane allows access to a single plane of data existing in a DRAWABLE.  This data may 
be processed for display or  used as ProcessDomain data.  
Notify enables ImportObscured events to be sent if data for one or more regions of a WINDOW are 
obscured and unavailable from BACKINGSTORE (see ImportObscured).  Drawable is the DRAWABLE 
resource supplying the data.  Src-x, src-y, width, and height specify the region of data to be imported 
from drawable.  Fill is the value to substitute for all regions that are obscured.  Bit-plane specifies the 
plane to be imported from drawable.
Bit-plane must have exactly one bit set to one (1), and the value of bit-plane must be less than 2n, 
where n is the depth of drawable.  This single bit selects the corresponding bit to be extracted from 
pixels within drawable.
Error	Cause
FloAlloc	insufficient resources
FloDrawable	invalid drawable
FloValue	invalid bit-plane or region (src-x, src-y, width, height)


ImportLUT

lut	XieTypLUT
Errors:	FloAlloc, FloAccess, FloLUT
Events:	none
ImportLUT allows access to lookup table data existing in a LUT resource.  These data are accepted by 
the Point, ExportLUT, and ExportLUT elements. 
Lut is the LUT resource supplying the lookup table. 
Attributes of the lookup table data are inherited from lut. 
Error	Cause
FloAlloc	insufficient resources
FloAccess	attempting to import from lut before it has been populated

ImportPhotomap allows access to image data existing in a Photomap.  This data may be processed for 
display or used as ProcessDomain data. 
Notify enables DecodeNotify events to be sent if anomalies are encountered while decoding com-
pressed data (see DecodeNotify and the DecodeTechnique descriptions).  Photomap is the Photomap 
resource supplying image data. 
Attributes of the source data are inherited from photomap. 
Error	Cause
FloAlloc	insufficient resources
FloAccess	attempting to import from photomap before it has been populated
FloPhotomap	invalid photomap
If the data imported from photomap are compressed, ImportPhotomap is generally responsible for decoding the data 
prior to forwarding the data to downstream elements.  An exception to this would be when an export element is a direct 
recipient of the data and the data are already encoded using the technique desired by the export element. 
If individual bands of TripleBand, BandByPlane data have different widths or heights (e.g. down-sampled YCbCr data), 
it is generally the client's responsibility to make inter-band dimensions match to render the image (e.g. use Geometry 
with appropriate band-mask and sample technique).  If ImportPhotomap's input data are TripleBand, BandByPixel, 
the dimensions of the output bands will match even if the encoded input data are down-sampled.

Process Elements
Overview
Process elements have one or more Phototag sources and have one output connection.  Each process 
element applies a specific operation to image data within an Active Photoflo.  Some process elements 
perform their operation on a single source of image data (e.g. Geometry).  Others, operate on either a 
pair of image sources or an image and a constant (e.g. Logical).  BandCombine associates bands from 
three SingleBand image sources to form a TripleBand image.  PasteUp can combine multiple images 
(tiles) to form a composite image.
The ConvertToIndex element can generate an event to notify the client about color allocation results. 
A process element will not be involved in the execution of a Photoflo if there is no eventual consumer of 
its output (i.e. no terminating export element). 
Limiting the Process
Processing may be limited to a subset of the bands present and a subset of pixels within the processed 
bands.  Data falling outside the selection criteria are passed through unaffected by the element's proc-
ess. 
Process Selected Bands
Some process elements accept a band-mask to restrict processing to a subset of the source data bands.  
Only bands selected by the band-mask are subject to processing.  Other bands present in the image are 
passed through to the output.  For example: a band-mask of 0012 indicates that only the least signifi-
cant band would be processed (see Orientation for a definition of band ordering). 
Process Intersecting Pixels
Dyadic process elements can accept a pair of data sources.  These sources are spatially registered at 
their origins (upper left corners).  Their class and type must match, but their dimensions (width and 
height) need not match.  The dimensions of the output are determined by src-1.  Processing is spatially 
restricted to the intersection of the sources on a per-band basis.  Data from src-1 that do not intersect 
with src-2 are passed through to the output. 
Process Selected Pixels
Some process elements accept a processing domain (ProcessDomain) to restrict processing to a subset 
of the source data pixels.  The processing domain represents either a list-of-rectangles or a bi-level 
SingleBand control-plane. 
A processing domain contains an x,y coordinate pair to spatially position the overall processing do-
main relative to the origin of the source(s).  It also contains a Phototag which references the import or 
process element that supplies the processing domain data.  The element referenced by the Phototag 
may provide a:
*	list-of-rectangles	imported using ImportROI or ImportClientROI.  Processing is restricted to the 
intersection of the data source(s) and any rectangle within the list.
*	control-plane	imported using ImportDrawable, ImportDrawablePlane, ImportPhotomap, or 
ImportClientPhoto; or the output of an upstream process element (e.g. Compare).  
Processing is restricted to the intersect of the data source(s) and non-zero locations 
within the control-plane.
Processing is not restricted if Phototag zero (0) is specified as the process domain's data source.

Data Types
In XIE, an image consists of one or three arrays of pixels, each of which is measured in terms of its 
width, height, and depth.  Each array, which represents a chromatic band of image data, is dimensioned 
independently.  The depth component of each array is expressed in quantization levels, or, the potential 
dynamic range of the pixels.  All process elements within XIE are capable of operating on image data 
that have a fixed number of quantization levels.  These data are said to be Constrained, such that the 
minimum possible intensity value of a pixel is zero (0), and the maximum possible intensity level is the 
number of quantization levels minus one. 
With the exception of operations that specifically change the number of quantization levels (e.g. Dither) 
all other operations that are performed on Constrained data will maintain the levels attribute from input 
to output.  An operation that computes a negative pixel value will set the resulting pixel to zero.  
Likewise, an operation that computes a pixel value that would exceed the levels attribute of the data, will 
saturate the resulting pixel at its maximum allowable value (i.e. levels-1).  This method of constraining 
image data is equivalent to the HardClip Constrain technique.
For some operations (e.g. Arithmetic operations), it is desirable to allow pixel values to stray beyond 
their Constrained values.  Such data are said to be Unconstrained, and may contain negative values, 
fractional values, or other values that might be beyond the normal display capabilities of a frame buffer. 
Performing a sequence of image operations on Unconstrained image data allows the maximum degree of 
precision to be maintained throughout the process (although there may be a cost in performance, 
depending on the server's capabilities).  Several XIE process elements are capable of operating on either 
Constrained or Unconstrained data.  These elements always output the same DataType as they are fed 
at their inputs.  An exception to this rule is that certain colorspace conversion techniques can accept 
either DataType, but are only capable of outputting Unconstrained data.

XIE provides a complementary pair of elements for converting image data between these two process-
ing styles.  The Unconstrain element simply removes the normal levels restrictions from the data.  The 
Constrain element provides a means of bringing the data back into a Constrained range.  A variety of 
techniques are available for this purpose that allow the pixel values to be level-shifted, scaled, clipped, 
rounded, etc.

Arithmetic produces output data by performing an addition, subtraction, minimum, or maximum op-
eration between two data sources or between a single data source and a constant.  Furthermore, multipli-
cation, division, or gamma correction may by applied to a single data source.
When two sources are involved, src-1 and src-2 are the Phototags of the elements supplying source 
data (constant is ignored). If the operation is to involve a constant, src-1 is one operand, src-2 must be 
zero, and constant is used as the other operand.  Domain may control the subset of source data that 
will be operated upon.  Operator is the arithmetic operation to be performed.  Band-mask specifies 
which bands are to be operated upon. 
When two sources are involved, all attributes, other than width and height, must match; all output at-
tributes are inherited from src-1.
Pixel computations that would lead to errors, will yield valid server-dependent values (e.g. dividing by a 
Constrained pixel value of zero might result in a value of levels-1) .  Using band-mask to select source 
data that have two (2) or less levels is not permitted.

BandExtract produces SingleBand output data from a TripleBand source by multiplying a pixel value 
from each source band by its corresponding coefficient and then summing the results with the bias 
value. 
Src is the Phototag of the element supplying source data.  Coefficients is a three (3) element array that 
determines the proportion of each source band pixel that is used to form the output.  The bias value is 
added to each output pixel.  Levels is used as the levels attribute of the output data if the src data are 
Constrained, otherwise it is ignored. 
The source data must be TripleBand, and all bands must have equal dimensions. The output data will 
be SingleBand, with levels taken from the levels parameter, if type is Constrained.  All other attributes 
are inherited from src.
No subsetting by ProcessDomain is provided (the entire image is processed).

BandExtract can be used to extract a band of luminance data from an RGB image.  It can also be used to compute

Blend produces output data from two data sources or a single data source and a constant.  Each output 
pixel is a percentage combination of the source values, as controlled by the alpha input or the alpha 
constant. 
When two sources are involved, src-1 and src-2 are the Phototags of the elements supplying source 
data (constant is ignored).  If the operation is to involve a constant, src-1 is one operand, src-2 must be 
zero, and constant is used as the other operand.  If alpha is non-zero, it controls the blend proportion 
for each pixel that is processed, otherwise alpha-const provides this control.  Domain may control the 
subset of source data that will be operated upon.  Band-mask specifies which bands are to be operated 
upon. 
When two sources are involved, all attributes, other that width and height, must match. If alpha is non-
zero, it must be a source of Constrained data. Using band-mask to select source data that have two (2) 
or less levels is not permitted.
Within the intersection of the source(s) and domain, each output pixel is a blend of the corresponding 
pixels from src-1 and src-2 (or src-1 pixels blended with constant).  The degree of blend is determined 
by the corresponding value taken from alpha or the value of alpha-const.  If alpha is non-zero, the pro-
portion of blend is further scaled by alpha-const: 
	output = src-1 * (1 - alpha / alpha-const) + src-2 * (alpha / alpha-const)
		(where alpha-const is greater than 0.0).
If alpha is zero:
	output = src-1 * (1 - alpha-const) + src-2 * alpha-const 
		(where alpha-const is in the range [0.0, 1.0]).

Compare takes two data sources or a single data source and a constant and generates a Boolean bitmap 
output which reflects the results of a point-wise comparison.  The output data has a value of 1 wherever 
the comparison is true, and a value of 0 everywhere else (i.e. comparison false or comparison not per-
formed).  Compare may be requested on a per-band basis, or for all bands taken together. 
When two sources are involved, src-1 and src-2 are the Phototags of the elements supplying source 
data (constant is ignored). If the operation is to involve a constant, src-1 is one operand, src-2 must be 
zero, and constant is used as the other operand.  Domain may control the subset of source data that 
will be compared.  Operator is the logical predicate operator used in the comparison. Combine is a 
Boolean which determines if the comparison should be done on a per-band basis, or on an all bands 
basis.  Band-mask specifies which bands are to be involved. 
If combine is true or src-1 is SingleBand, the output data will form a single Boolean bitmap.  If src-1 is 
TripleBand and combine is false, the output data will yield three separate Boolean bitmaps (for this 
case band-mask must specify all bands).
If src-1 is TripleBand and combine is true, only the EQ and NE operators are allowed;  equality is 
established for each band selected by band-mask, and then the result is logically ANDed to derive 
equality (inequality is a logical NOT of this result).  For this case, width and height must match for all 
bands selected by band-mask.

Compare does not support inter-band distance metrics, therefore combined  LT, LE, GT, and GE operators are not 
supported. Clients may implement these using other elements in concert with Compare. 
Typical uses for Compare include: creating data to be used as a control-plane for a ProcessDomain, and converting 
index data into bitonal image data.

Constrain applies a quantization model to the image data to convert the data to a fixed number of 
quantization levels.  Application of the quantization model may involve steps such as range shifting, 
scaling, clipping, and rounding. 
Src is the Phototag of the element supplying source data.  Levels is the number of quantization levels 
desired in the output data.  Constrain specifies the ConstrainTechnique to be used when constraining 
the data.  Constrain-params is the list of additional parameters required by constrain. 
If the input image is already Constrained the data will be re-Constrained. 
No subsetting by band mask or ProcessDomain is provided (the entire image is Constrained).

ConvertFromIndex converts COLORMAP index data into achromatic or trichromatic data. 
Src is the Phototag of the element supplying source data.  Colormap is the COLORMAP from which to 
obtain the value for each output pixel.  Class specifies the DataClass of the desired output data.  
Precision specifies how many bits (most significant) are to be used from the red, green, and blue values 
found in colormap. 
If class is SingleBand and a trichromatic colormap is specified (StaticColor, PseudoColor, 
TrueColor, or DirectColor), the gray shade for each pixel is taken from the red values in col-
ormap. 
If class is TripleBand and an achromatic colormap is specified (StaticGray or GrayScale), the 
red band will be replicated to populate the green and blue output bands. 
The depth of colormap must match the levels attribute of src (i.e. 2depth must equal levels). 
No subsetting by band mask or ProcessDomain is provided (the entire image is converted). 
Error	Cause
FloAlloc	insufficient resources
FloSource	invalid src
FloColormap	invalid colormap
FloMatch	levels of src do not match depth of colormap
FloValue	invalid class or precision
To achieve predictable results, the client should not modify colormap cells referenced by the source data while the 
Photoflo is Active (see Await for synchronization help). 
A value of bitsPerRGBValue or less (defined in the VISUAL of colormap) is usually appropriate for precision.
Compare can be used to convert index data into bitonal data.  Use ConvertFromIndex followed by BandExtract to 
convert colored index data into full fidelity achromatic data.

ConvertFromRGB converts RGB source data to an alternate colorspace. 
Src is the Phototag of the element supplying source data (RGB assumed).  Convert is the Convert-
FromRGBTechnique that will be used in the conversion to the destination colorspace.  Convert-
params is the list of additional parameters required by convert. 
In addition to colorspace conversion, some techniques allow for adjusting the white point of the output 
data (refer to Appendix A Convert From RGB Technique, for more information on conversion 
techniques). 
The source data must be TripleBand, and all bands must have equal dimensions. The type and levels 
of the output data are determined by convert technique parameters.  All other attributes are inherited 
from src.
No subsetting by ProcessDomain is provided (the entire image is processed).

ConvertToIndex allocates and/or matches colors or gray shades, as required, from a COLORMAP.  It 
produces pixel indices as output data, and records indices that it allocates in a ColorList.  The specified 
color-alloc technique may generate a ColorAlloc event to warn the client that results are of lesser fidel-
ity than desired. 
Notify allows the client to be notified about inferior results from color allocation or matching.  Src is the 
Phototag of the element supplying Constrained source data.  Colormap is the COLORMAP from which 
colors or gray shades are allocated and/or matched.  Color-list is the ColorList where allocated COL-
ORMAP indices are to be stored.  Color-alloc specifies the desired ColorAllocTechnique.  Color-alloc-
params is the list of additional parameters required by color-alloc. 
Color-list is purged of any colors it already contains when Photoflo execution begins.  Allocated 
COLORMAP indices can be freed using PurgeColorList, DestroyColorList, or by making color-list the 
target of an Active Photoflo. 
Error	Cause
FloAlloc	insufficient resources

FloAccess	color-list is already being used by another Active Photoflo
FloMatch	unequal inter-band dimensions (width or height)

ConvertToIndex is usually a preparatory step for an ExportDrawable element.  Alternatively, continuous-tone data 
can be converted to a fixed palette of COLORMAP index entries using Point.  Or BandExtract can be used if the 
COLORMAP contains a ramp of colors or gray shades (e.g. a Standard-COLORMAP or a TrueColor visual).  
Bitonal image data can be presented directly to ExportDrawablePlane, allowing the GCONTEXT mechanism to 
translate ones and zeros in the image into foreground and background colors in the DRAWABLE. 
If colormap is static, image colors or gray shades must be matched to those available in colormap.  Since no cells 
are actually allocated, color-list can be specified as zero (0).  Of the three standard techniques defined in this document 
only ColorAlloc_Match is appropriate for static COLORMAPs.  If colormap is dynamic, image colors or gray 
shades may be matched or allocated from colormap depending on the color-alloc technique; colormap and the list of 
cells actually allocated are stored in color-list.
Although the three standard techniques defined in this document allocate read-only cells, ConvertToIndex could be 
extended with private techniques that allocate, match, or write into read-write cells.

ConvertToRGB converts alternate colorspace source data into RGB data. 
Src is the Phototag of the element supplying source data.  Convert is the ConvertFromRGBTechnique 
that will be used in the conversion from the source colorspace.  Convert-params is the list of additional

In addition to colorspace conversion, some techniques allow for adjusting the white point of the source 
data prior to conversion and compressing the gamut of the output data (refer to Appendix A Convert 
To RGB Technique, for more information on conversion techniques). 
The source data must be TripleBand, and all bands must have equal dimensions. The type and levels 
of the output data are determined by convert technique parameters.  All other attributes are inherited

Convolve produces output data by convolving each input pixel value (and surrounding area) with the 
specified convolution kernel.
Src is the Phototag of the element supplying source data.  Domain may control the subset of the image 
that will be operated upon.  Kernel contains the coefficients used in the convolution process.  Kernel-
size specifies the dimension of kernel.  Band-mask specifies which bands are to be operated upon.   
Convolve specifies the ConvolveTechnique for handling edge conditions (when kernel requires data 
outside of src).  Convolve-params is the list of additional parameters required by convolve.  
Kernel represents a square array of float data which has odd dimensions.  Thus, a single dimension is 
used to specify, kernel-size. 
Using band-mask to select source data that have two (2) or less levels is not permitted.
All output data attributes are inherited from the source data.

Dither is used to reduce the number of quantization levels in an image.  It accomplishes this by af-
fecting adjacent pixels (area affect) to make up for the lack of depth resolution.

Geometry is used to perform geometric transformations on image data.  Linear geometric resampling 
operations are implemented, such as: crop, mirror, scale, shear, rotate, translate, and combinations 
thereof. 
Src is the Phototag of the element supplying source data.  Width and height specify the dimensions of 
the output data.  Coefficients is a list of values (a,b,c,d,tx,ty) that control the geometric transforma-
tion.  Constant is a fill value used for output pixels that do not map back to a src pixel.  Band-mask 
specifies which bands are to be operated upon.  Sample is the GeometryTechnique to be used for ret-
rospectively resampling src.  Sample-params is the list of additional parameters required by sample. 
Figure 7-2 shows a combined crop and scale for a src with dimensions w and h, and output width w' 
and height h'. The mapping between the coordinate systems is specified from output back to src: that 
is, for each output pixel (x',y'),  the coordinate location (x,y) at which to sample src is given by:

  
Geometry can be visualized as stepping through each possible output pixel location in turn, and 
computing the location from which to obtain each input pixel value.  Often a given output pixel location 
(x',y'), will not correspond exactly to a single pixel in the input image.  The sample technique is used 
to determine how the input data will be interpolated to produce each output pixel value.
 
Figure 7-2   A sample geometric transform: crop and scale
The region to be cropped in the input image is implicitly defined by the dimensions of the output image 
and the mapping from output to input coordinates.  Depending on the size of the input and output 
images, the amount of scaling specified, and the amount of translation in the mapping,  the shadow of 
the output image may extend beyond the boundaries of the input image, as in Figure 7-3.  Pixels in the 
output image which map off the edge of the input image will be assigned the constant value.
 
Figure 7-3   Background fill used for pixels beyond the edge
Transformation Coefficients
The coordinate mapping (a,b,c,d,tx,ty), together with the output width and height, fully specify the 
geometric transformation.   To aid in computing the desired transform, one might:
*	Draw a picture of the input and output images.  Label  the corners of the output image A,B,C,D.  They will have 
coordinates x',y' at (0,0),  (width-1,0),  (0,height-1), and (width-1,height-1),
*	Next compute or deduce the coordinates (x,y) of A,B,C,D in the input coordinate space,
*	For three corners (preferably those with a 0 for either x' or y'), write down the basic mapping equation with 
known (x,y) and (x',y') specified.  Each corner will give two equations, and simultaneously solving the six 
equations for the three corners will allow (a,b,c,d,tx,ty) to be deduced. The remaining corner may be used to 
check that these parameters have been derived correctly.
The following briefly (and approximately) summarizes the intuitive role of each parameter:
a,d	Scaling parameters. Increasing a and d will make the output image appear smaller, 
whereas decreasing them will make the output pixels appear larger.
b,c	Rotation/skew parameters. If b and c are zero, the output image will be a 
rectangular scaling of the input image.  If a and d are both zero, b is one and c is 
negative one, the image will appear rotated.  The magnitude of b and c will affect 
scaling as well, if a and d are zero.  If  more than two of (a,b,c,d) are non-zero, 
the effect is complicated. The image may appear skewed and scaled. 
tx,ty	Translation parameters. Used to specify the offset between input and output 
coordinate systems.
width,height	These specify the output image dimensions of the selected band(s).  Note that 
increasing the output image height and width over the input image size will not by 
itself cause magnification ¾ if a and d are one (1) and b and c are zero (0),  the 
output image will have the same appearance as the input, except that the borders 
will shrink or expand (as determined by width and height) and new areas of the im-
age will be filled with constant. 

Trichromatic image bands can be operate individually, all together, or in any combination, using band-
mask. Since applying the same (a,b,c,d,tx,ty) mapping to inputs with diverse sizes will specify 
different transformations, operating on all bands in unison (band-mask of 1112) is most appropriate if 
the dimensions of all bands are equal.  No subsetting by ProcessDomain is provided (selected bands 
are processed in their entirety).

Logical performs per-pixel bit-wise operations on a single data source, or between two data sources, or 
between a single data source and a constant. 
When two sources are involved, src-1 and src-2 are the Phototags of the elements supplying source 
data (constant is ignored). If the operation is to involve a constant, src-1 is one operand, src-2 must be 
zero, and constant is used as the other operand.  Domain may control the subset of source data that 
will be operated upon.  Operator is the logical operator to be used.  Band-mask specifies which bands 
are to be operated upon. 
The value of operator matches the GC-function  values defined by the core protocol 
specification for CreateGC.  The output of Logical is determined by the number of data sources and 
operator:

MatchHistogram produces output data which differs from the source data in terms of its pixel value 
distribution, or histogram. It allows the client to specify the desired state of the resulting data's histo-
gram (algorithmic description of resulting histogram shape). 
Src is the Phototag of the element supplying source data.  Domain may control the subset of the source 
data to operated upon.  Shape is a HistogramShape that specifies the form of the desired output data 
histogram.  Shape-params is the list of additional parameters required by shape. 
The source data must be Constrained and SingleBand, and it must have three (3) or more levels.
When a ProcessDomain is used, only data that intersects with domain is included in the histogram, 
and only that data will be affected in the result of the histogram matching operation (all other data will 
pass-through unchanged).
Error	Cause
FloAlloc	insufficient resources

FloDomain	invalid domain
FloMatch	invalid src data: Unconstrained or TripleBand or bitonal
FloTechnique	invalid histogram shape or shape-params
The Point element can also be used to re-shape an image's histogram using an appropriate LUT.

Math applies a single operand mathematical operation to the source data on a point-wise basis. 
Src is the Phototag of the element supplying source data.  Domain may control the subset of the image 
which will be operated upon.  Operator is the mathematical operation to be applied.  Band-mask speci-
fies which bands are to be operated upon. 
Pixel computations that would lead to errors will yield valid server-dependent values (e.g. the log of a 
Constrained pixel value of zero might result in a value of zero).  Using band-mask to select source data 
that have two (2) or less levels is not permitted.
All output data attributes are inherited from the source data.

PasteUp is an N-input translate operation which outputs data constructed from various source data tiles 
or a constant value. 
Each of the tiles specifies a src (the Phototag of the element supplying source data), and the coordi-
nates, dst-x and dst-y, where the tile belongs in the output data.  Width and height specify the full extent 
of the output data.  Constant is the fill value to as the output data for any region that is not specified as 
a tile.
Each region of the output data is defined by a tile's destination coordinates, dst-x and dst-y, and its src 
dimensions.  For output regions where no tile provides input, the value of constant is used.  If tiles 
overlap, a stacking order rule defines which pixel value will be output: the last tile (involved in the 
overlap) in the list of tiles will provide the output pixel. 
At least one tile must be supplied.  Except for width and height, all attributes of each source tile must 
match.  In addition, for TripleBand input, inter-band dimensions within each tile must match.
No subsetting by band mask or ProcessDomain is provided.

Point maps source pixel values to output pixel values using a lookup table (LUT) .
Src is the Phototag of the element supplying Constrained source data.  Lut is the Phototag of the 
element supplying the lookup table array(s).  Domain may control the subset of source data which will 
be operated upon.  Band-mask specifies which bands are to be operated upon (all bands must be 
specified if lut is SingleBand and src is TripleBand).
The output is Constrained, with the width and height taken from src, and class and levels taken from 
lut.  When src is SingleBand and lut is TripleBand, for the bands that are indicated by band-mask, the 
output bands are re-mapped through their respective lut bands, whereas the other bands are just 
replications of the single src band.  If domain is used, the class and levels of lut must match those of 
src.
Each lut array must contain sufficient entries so that all potential pixel values found in src can form a 
valid index into the array.  Generally each src pixel value is used directly as an index into a lut array. 
When TripleBand src data are re-mapped through a SingleBand lut however, pixel values from all three 
src bands are combined to form an array index (for this case, width and height must match for all 
bands).  Figure 7-4 presents the algorithm for computing combined array indices.

Export Elements
Element categories
Export elements are used to send image data out of a Photoflo.  Each export element has a single Photo-
tag source but does not provide an output connection.  There are two types of export elements:
  ExportResource elements export data to a server resource (DRAWABLE, LUT, Photomap, or ROI).
  ExportClient elements produce data for client retrieval. They provide the input data for the GetClient-
Data protocol request.
Export to Client
ExportClient elements provide data for the client. Element parameters fully describe the format or 
organization the data is to have as it is transported through the protocol stream.  The data itself must be 
retrieved using the GetClientData protocol request while the Photoflo is Active. 
Servers are required to buffer a non-zero amount of data per ExportClient element.  Beyond that 
point execution may be suspended until the client retrieves sufficient data. 
Events generated
ExportClient elements can generate ExportAvailable events to notify the client when the data is 
available for retrieval.  ExportAvailable events may be:
  disabled (i.e. no event is sent),
  enabled only when data first becomes available from the element,
  enabled each time the element's data buffer transitions from empty to non-empty.


ExportClientHistogram
XieFloExportClientHistogram
notify	XieTypExportNotify
src	XieTypPhototag
domain	XieTypProcessDomain
Errors:	FloAlloc, FloSource, FloDomain, FloMatch, FloValue
Events:	none
ExportClientHistogram generates a histogram of the pixel values found in the source data.  It prepares 
histogram data that can be retrieved by the client using the GetClientData protocol request.  An event 
can be requested that will notify the client when histogram data becomes available.
Notify allows the client to be notified when the histogram data becomes available.  Src is the Phototag 
of the element supplying SingleBand Constrained source data.  Domain may control the subset of the 
source data from which the distribution will be generated.  
The data generated for the client is a list of HistogramData where each entry consists of an value (i.e. a 
pixel value) followed by the count of pixels found with that value.  If the number of pixels for a given 
value exceeds the capacity of count (type CARD32), that count will be returned at the maximum value 
(i.e. 232-1).  Pixel values that are not found in the data are not included in the histogram data (i.e. no 
entries are returned where count is zero). 
If notify is true, the total number of histogram entries are reported in the data field of the ExportAvail-
able event. 
The histogram is returned as numeric values (see HistogramData), as such, the byte order of the data is 
determined at core protocol connection setup time.
Error	Cause
FloAlloc	insufficient resources
FloSource	invalid src
FloDomain	invalid domain
FloMatch	Unconstrained src data
TripleBand src data
FloValue	invalid notify
All data that are generated by ExportClientHistogram must be retrieved by the client using GetClientData before 
the Photoflo can exit from the Active state. 
Histograms of TripleBand images are not supported directly.  However, BandSelect may be used to choose a single 
band of data, or BandExtract may be used to combine data from multiple bands into a single band of data.  A histogram 
of this single band of data could then be generated using ExportClientHistogram.

Errors:	FloAlloc, FloSource, FloValue
Events:	none
ExportClientLUT allows data imported from an ImportLUT or ImportClientLUT element to be retrieved 
by the client.  The actual transport of lookup table data through the protocol stream is requested using 
the GetClientData protocol request. 
Notify allows the client to be notified when data become available.  Src is the Phototag of the element 
supplying lookup table data.  Band-order is the order in which TripleBand arrays are transmitted 
through the protocol stream.  Start is the index of the first array entry that should be returned.  Length 
is the number of array entries that should be returned.
If notify is requested, the ExportAvailable event's data field will report the total number of array entries 
that can be retrieved from the band specified by the event.
The size of each array entry is either 1, 2, or 4 bytes; the smallest size into which the output quantization 
levels can be stored.  When array entries require multiple bytes, the byte order per entry is determined 
in the same manner as other numeric data: it is the byte orientation established at core X connection 
setup time. 
Error	Cause
FloAlloc	insufficient resources
FloSource	invalid src
FloMatch	start + length exceeds number of entries in an array
FloValue	invalid notify or band-order
When the client attempts to retrieve data from an ExportClientLUT element, the server responds with one or more 
complete array entries per protocol reply (see GetClientData).  All data must be retrieved by the client before the 
Photoflo can leave the Active state.

Errors:	FloAlloc, FloSource, FloMatch, FloValue, FloTechnique
Events:	none
ExportClientPhoto makes image data available to the protocol stream.  The attributes of the exported 
data are determined by the attributes of the source data.  The format of the data is specified by the en-
code technique and encode-params.  The actual transport of image data through the protocol stream is 
requested using the GetClientData protocol request. 
Notify allows the client to be notified when image data become available.  Src is the Phototag of the 
element supplying Constrained data.  Encode is the EncodeTechnique that will be used to compress of 
format the exported data.  Encode-params is the list of additional parameters required by encode. 
Error	Cause
FloAlloc	insufficient resources
FloSource	invalid src
FloMatch	Unconstrained src data
FloValue	invalid notify
FloTechnique	invalid encode technique or encode-params
ServerChoice is not a valid encode technique for ExportClientPhoto.
Depending on encode, the export process may cause the data to be decoded, encoded, or otherwise reformatted by the 
server.  If ExportClientPhoto is fed directly from an ImportClientPhoto or ImportPhotomap element, and the 
attributes of the raw data that are given to the import element match the requirements of the encode technique, the 
raw data can bypass the normal decode function of the import element and be forwarded directly to ExportPhotomap 
(this is an implementation-specific optimization).
If TripleBand data are given to an encode technique that will interleave the output data BandByPixel, the dimensions 
of each src band must match.
All data must be retrieved by the client, using the GetClientData protocol request, before the Photoflo can exit from 
the Active state. 



ExportClientROI
XieFloExportClientROI
notify	XieTypExportNotify
src	XieTypPhototag
Errors:	FloAlloc, FloSource, FloValue
Events:	none
ExportClientROI allows a list-of-rectangles, imported from an ImportROI or ImportClientROI element, 
to be retrieved by the client.  The actual transport of lookup table data through the protocol stream is 
requested using the GetClientData protocol request. 
Notify allows the client to be notified when data become available.  Src is the Phototag of the element 
supplying the list-of-rectangles. 
If notify is requested, the ExportAvailable event's data field will report the total number of rectangles 
that can be retrieved.
Each rectangle is described using numeric values (see Rectangle), as such, the byte order of the data is 
determined at core protocol connection setup time.
Error	Cause
FloAlloc	insufficient resources
FloSource	invalid src
FloValue	invalid notify
When the client attempts to retrieve data from an ExportClientROI element, the server responds with one or more 
complete Rectangles per protocol reply (see GetClientData).  All data must be retrieved by the client before the 
Photoflo can leave the Active state. 


Export to Resource
ExportResource elements emit data to server resources: either core X DRAWABLEs, or XIE LUT, 
Photomap, or ROI resources. 
For ExportResource elements that assign attributes to XIE resources, the association between the 
resource identifier (XID) and the new attributes and data does not occur until the Photoflo successfully 
completes (i.e. leaves the Active state).   (See LUT, Photomap, and ROI resources in Chapter 4.)

ExportDrawable allows COLORMAP index data to be exported to a WINDOW or PIXMAP. 
Src is the Phototag of the element supplying Constrained source data (index data assumed).  Drawable 
is the WINDOW or PIXMAP into which the data will be written.  Gc is the GCONTEXT to be used when 
transferring pixels to drawable.  Dst-x and dst-y specify where the data should be placed in drawable. 
The following components are used from gc: function, plane-mask, subwindow-mode, 
clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, and clip-mask. 
The levels of src must exactly match the depth of drawable and gc (i.e. levels must be 2depth). 
Error	Cause
FloAlloc	insufficient resources
FloSource	invalid src
FloDrawable	invalid drawable
FloGC	invalid gc
FloMatch	invalid src data (TripleBand, levels doesn't match depth, or Unconstrained)
ExportDrawable assumes its input is COLORMAP index data.  Sources of such data include: ImportClientPhoto, 
ImportDrawable, ImportPhotomap, BandExtract, ConvertToIndex, Point, and elements that have processed 
index data.

ExportDrawablePlane allows SingleBand single bit (bitonal) data to be exported to a WINDOW, 
PIXMAP, or BITMAP. 
Src is the Phototag of the element supplying Constrained bitonal source data.  Drawable is the WIN-
DOW, PIXMAP, or BITMAP into which the data will be written.  Gc is the GCONTEXT to be used when 
transferring pixels to drawable.  Dst-x and dst-y specify where the data should be placed in drawable. 
The following components are used from gc: function, plane-mask, foreground, back-
ground, fill-style, subwindow-mode, clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, and clip-
mask.  For the fill-style component of gc, values of FillSolid and FillTiled are treated 
as synonyms for FillOpaqueStippled. 
Error	Cause
FloAlloc	insufficient resources
FloSource	invalid src
FloDrawable	invalid drawable
FloGC	invalid gc
FloMatch	invalid src data (TripleBand, levels > 2, or not Constrained)
Bitonal data can be exported to a DRAWABLE of any depth if an appropriate GCONTEXT is supplied.  The 
foreground and background pixel values of gc can be used to map image pixels to COLORMAP colors during the 
export process. 


ExportLUT
XieFloExportLUT

merge	BOOL
start	XieTypTripletofCARD32
Errors:	FloAlloc, FloSource
Events:	none
ExportLUT allows data imported from an ImportLUT or ImportClientLUT element to be saved in an ex-
isting LUT resource. 
Src is the Phototag of the element supplying lookup table data.  Lut is the LUT to receive the data.  
Merge specifies that new array entries from src should replace entries that already exist within lut.  Start 
is the index of the first array entry that should be written in lut.
If merge is false, start must be 0 for each band.  In this case, lut will inherit the attributes of src and be 
populated with its data.  The previous attributes and data of lut are overwritten when the photoflo 
completes. 
If merge is true and lut has existing attributes, the data from src will replace the data from lut, beginning 
at position start.  The attributes of src must match those of lut, and the combination of start and the 
length of src must specify a valid sub-range existing within lut.  If merge is true but lut has not yet been 
populated, it is an error.
Error	Cause
FloAlloc	insufficient resources
FloSource	invalid src
FloLUT	invalid lut
FloMatch	merge true and attributes do not match between src and lut
merge true and start + src length is not a sub-range of lut
FloValue	merge false and start is non-zero

ExportPhotomap allows data resulting from Photoflo operations to be saved in an existing Photomap. 
Src is the Phototag of the element supplying source data.  Photomap is the Photomap to receive the 
data.  Encode is the EncodeTechnique by which the image is to be compressed or formatted. Encode-
params is the list of additional parameters required by encode. 
Photomap will inherit the attributes of src and be populated with its data.  The previous attributes and 
data of photomap are overwritten when the Photoflo completes. 
Error	Cause
FloAlloc	insufficient resources
FloSource	invalid src
FloPhotomap	invalid photomap
FloTechnique	invalid encode technique or encode-params
Depending on encode, the export process may cause the data to be decoded, encoded, or otherwise reformatted by the 
server.  If ExportPhotomap is fed directly from an ImportClientPhoto or ImportPhotomap element, and the 
attributes of the raw data that are given to the import element match the requirements of the encode technique, the 
raw data can bypass the normal decode function of the import element and be forwarded directly to ExportPhotomap 
(this is an implementation-specific optimization).
If encode is ServerChoice, the server is free to choose an encode technique for the exported data.  An optional hint 
can be provided to help the server make its choice, but the server can ignore the hint. PreferTime hints that retrieval 
performance is the desired metric, whereas PreferSpace indicates that frugal use of storage space is more important.  If 
ExportPhotomap is receiving data from an adjacent upstream import element, ServerChoice may choose to pass the 
import element's input data directly to the Photomap, otherwise a lossless technique will be chosen. The actual 
technique chosen by the server can be obtained using QueryPhotomap after the Photoflo completes.
If TripleBand data are given to an encode technique that will interleave the output data BandByPixel, the dimensions 
of each src band must match.

A ColorAlloc event notifies the client that a ConvertToIndex element has completed color allocation, 
but has produced a result of lesser fidelity than was requested using the technique that was specified 
for the ConvertToIndex element. 
Instance, src, and type identify the Photoflo and specific ConvertToIndex element from which the

A DecodeNotify event notifies the client that anomalies were encountered while decoding a compressed 
image (see the notify parameters of ImportClientPhoto and ImportPhotomap). Either an error has been 
encountered while decoding an image, or the image data received does not satisfy the expected 
dimensions. 
Instance, src, and type identify the Photoflo and element from which the DecodeNotify event originated. 
Decode is the DecodeTechnique being used.  Data-width and data-height are the dimensions 
discovered while decoding the data. Band-number associates the event with the band of the image 
where the problem was encountered.  Aborted is true if decoding was aborted, or false if recovery was 
possible. 
Recovery from a decode error may result in some missing or garbled image data. This may also cause 
the height of the decoded data to be less than was expected.  If data-width or data-height do not 
match the width and height specified to ImportClientPhoto, the image data is clipped or padded (with 
zeros), as required, to enforce the ImportClientPhoto specified dimensions.

An ExportAvailable event notifies the client that an ExportClient element has data available (see 
the notify parameter of the applicable ExportClient element).  If notify was specified as FirstData, 
this event will only be sent the first time data become available from the ExportClient element.  
Otherwise (i.e. NewData was specified) this event will be generated each time the amount of data 
available changes from zero to non-zero.
Instance, src, and type identify the Photoflo and specific ExportClient element from which the 
ExportAvailable event originated. Band-number associates the event with a specific band of the image 
or LUT.  Data is information specific to type (e.g. the number of LUT entries or ROI rectangles avail-
able).
Where there is a single ExportClient element, the client can just read bytes or be event-driven.  For Photoflos 
containing multiple ExportClient elements, the client should be event-driven.

An ImportObscured event notifies the client an ImportDrawable or ImportDrawablePlane element has 
encountered obscured regions in a WINDOW that cannot be retrieved from BACKINGSTORE (see the 
notify parameter of the import element).  A separate ImportObscured event is returned for each affected 
region.
Instance and src identify the Photoflo and the specific import element from which the ImportObscured 
event originated.  Window identifies the WINDOW.  The obscured region of the window is specified by 
x, y, width, and height.
Note: image data within obscured regions will be populated with the fill value supplied to the import element.

A PhotofloDone event notifies the client that a Photoflo has left the Active state.  It is enabled by the 
notify parameter of the ExecutePhotoflo and ExecuteImmediate requests. 
Instance identifies the Photoflo from which the PhotofloDone event originated.  Outcome indicates the 
reason the Photoflo left the Active state. 
If the Photoflo terminated due to an error condition, the details concerning the error have preceded this event in an 
error message.
