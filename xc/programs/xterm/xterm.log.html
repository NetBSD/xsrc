This file contains a list of the changes that I have made for XFree86 xterm,
from the notes that I add when submitting a patch.
<P>
You should note that other changes have been made as well, by other people,
to fix bugs and correct ifdef's for portability.  All of these are summarized
in the XFree86 CHANGELOG (found in the unbundled tree,
xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86).

<H1><A NAME="xterm_68">Patch #68 - 1998/3/4 - XFree86 3.9Ad and 3.3.1z</A></H1>

This corrects another problem with the logic for highlightColor resource.
As reported by David Dawes:
<blockquote>
	I've just noticed a problem with with the "inverse" control sequence
	(ESC[7m) with the 3.3.2 xterm.  What it does is sets the background
	black, and the text the usual foreground colour rather than simply
	swapping the foreground/background.

</blockquote>
This appears to be because when I added logic to check that the highlightColor
was distinct from foreground and background colors, I did not add a further
check to see that it was not black (I would make an explicit check for the
resource not being set, but see nothing definite in the headers that would let
me reference an explicitly-undefined Pixel value, though there are some
implications in xpm.h).  But this should work.

<H1><A NAME="xterm_67">Patch #67 - 1998/2/23 - XFree86 3.9Ad and 3.3.1e</A></H1>

This patch does the following:
<UL>
	<LI>improve test for highlightColor so that xterm does not attempt to
	  use that unless it is different from the foreground and background
	  colors (reported by Stefan Dalibor
	  &lt;Stefan.Dalibor@informatik.uni-erlangen.de&gt;.
<P>
	  I could not reproduce this until I noticed that the -rev option
	  exposed it nicely.

	<LI>remove ich and ich1 from xterm and xterm-8bit terminfo descriptions.
	  SVr4 terminfo documents that you must not combine these with
	  smir/rmir, but ncurses allows it, opening a hole.  Solaris 2.6 vi
	  does not work properly if it is using a terminfo description when
	  these are combined, since it was written to accommodate old terminals
	  that required it (reported by Stephen Marley).

	<LI>restore 1-pixel overlap of scrollbar border with left edge of window
	  (reported by Jim Burmeister &lt;jimb@metrolink.com&gt;).

	<LI>add a configure option, --enable-logfile-exec, which allows the
	  user to specify a pipe for logfile.  This defines ALLOWLOGFILEEXEC.

	<LI>makes the ALLOWLOGFILEEXEC code compile & run, if configured.

	<LI>minor documentation nits.
</UL>

<H1><A NAME="xterm_66">Patch #66 - 1998/2/16 - XFree86 3.9Ad and 3.3.1d</A></H1>

This fixes the problem reported with failure to build the <EM>resize</EM>
program (BSDI, OSF/1) due to not having &lt;termcap.h&gt;, by changing the
ifdef to one that would be set only if the file exists (not currently
specified, except by the standalone configure script).  We do not really need
to include &lt;termcap.h&gt; to build, but only for a clean compile, since it
may declare the tgetent() prototype.

I also updated the man-page for <EM>resize</EM>, since I had recently noticed
that it can be used to resize <EM>xterm</EM> using the "Sun" control sequences
option.

<H1><A NAME="xterm_65">Patch #65 - 1998/2/14 - XFree86 3.9Ad and 3.3.1c</A></H1>

This is a small patch to xterm's 8-bit terminal description.  I noticed
while testing ncurses that I had specified the wrong (VT100-style) codes
for the F1-F4.  Xterm only uses VT220-style function keys in 8-bit mode.

<H1><A NAME="xterm_64">Patch #64 - 1998/2/8 - XFree86 3.9Ad</A></H1>

This fixes the following problems with xterm:
<UL>
	<LI>save/restore the ANSI foreground and background colors with the other
	  visible attributes in the save-cursor and restore-cursor operations.
	  This works around a problem with vim, which apparently assumed that
	  switching between the normal and alternate screens resets the colors
	  (reported by Jim Battle &lt;jb@chromatic.com&gt;).
<P>
	  It would be nice to implement save/restore cursor as a stack (and
	  solve this type of problem completely), but that would lead to
	  incompatibility with applications which assume they are running with a
	  VT100 or VT220.

	<LI>corrects behavior of a restore-cursor operation which does not
	  follow a save-cursor (it is supposed to set the character sets
	  to a known initial state).

	<LI>extends the sunKeyboard resource (and menu toggle) to modify the
	  home, end and delete keys on a Sun or PC editing keypad, making them
	  generate codes compatible with DEC VT220's Find, Select and Remove
	  keys.

	<LI>corrects a length in checking command-line options, which caused the
	  "-help" message to not work when X was not running.

	<LI>adds some detail to the man-page (requested by Jason Bacon
	  &lt;acadix@execpc.com&gt;)

	<LI>modify the standalone configure script to ignore the broken nsl and
	  socket libraries on IRIX 6.2 (the ones on 5.2 also are broken, so
	  this change just widens the check for the system version number).
</UL>

<H1><A NAME="xterm_63">Patch #63 - 1998/2/5 - XFree86 3.9Ad</A></H1>

This is another patch from Bjorn Helgaas &lt;helgaas@rsn.hp.com&gt;, which I've
reviewed (and learned some).  Following are his notes:
<P>
I poked around some more and finally got xterm-62 to build and run
cleanly on HP-UX 10.20.  Here are the patches.  They look sort of
ugly, so here's a little explanation:
<UL>
        <LI>aclocal.m4: Removed side effects from the AC_CACHE_VAL
        commands in CF_FUNC_TGETENT.  Previously, LIBS was set inside
        AC_CACHE_VAL, which worked fine the first time configure was
        run, but failed if there were cached values.

        <LI>aclocal.m4: Added temporary setting of LIBS before
        AC_TRY_LINK in CF_FUNC_TGETENT.  Previously, the last value set
        by the AC_TRY_RUN loop was used, so only -lcurses was checked.

        <LI>configure.in: Added temporary setting of CPPFLAGS before
        AC_CHECK_HEADERS for X11 files.  Previously &lt;X11/DECkeysym.h&gt;
        and &lt;X11/Xpoll.h&gt; were found only if they were in the compiler's
        default include directories, even if `--x-includes=DIR' had been
        used or AC_PATH_XTRA had found them elsewhere.
</UL>
The problem on HP-UX was that we were linking with -lcurses rather than
-ltermcap due to the second bullet above, and apparently something in
HP-UX curses is broken.  This seems very strange, because the only thing
used is tgetent, which should affect any tty/pty configuration, but I
lost interest in tracking down the exact problem.

<H1><A NAME="xterm_62">Patch #62 - 1998/1/23 - XFree86 3.9Ac</A></H1>

This is a patch mostly by Bjorn Helgaas &lt;helgaas@dhc.net&gt; (I added the
os2main.c change, and a little of the documentation).  From Bjorn's
description:
<UL>
	<LI>If you use the "-hc &lt;color&gt;" option or set the "highlightColor"
	  resource, text is highlighted by changing only the background color,
	  rather than using reverse video.  I find this easier to read,
	  especially when selecting multi-colored text, and it is similar to
	  the way netscape shows selections.

	<LI>Most of the code changes are under "#if OPT_HIGHLIGHT_COLOR".  The
	  principal exception is in screen.c, where I added a couple calls to
	  resetXtermGC().  This seems like it could be a bug even without
	  the color highlighting changes (though I don't pretend to understand
	  all the logic).
</UL>

<H1><A NAME="xterm_61">Patch #61 - 1998/1/17 - XFree86 3.9Ac</A></H1>

This patch modifies the reset behavior of xterm slightly:
<UL>
	<LI>change the terminfo entry so that rs1 (one of the strings used by
	  the 'reset' program) does a hard reset rather than switching
	  character sets.  This is more in accord with other terminal
	  descriptions.

	<LI>modifies the treatment of hard reset by the xterm program to
	  reset the saved lines.

	<LI>corrects hard reset by also resetting user-defined keys (DECUDK).
</UL>

<H1><A NAME="xterm_60">Patch #60 - 1998/1/10 - XFree86 3.9Ab</A></H1>

This fixes some minor bugs and adds new functionality:
<UL>
	<LI>add support for blinking text.
<UL>
	  <LI>This does not actually cause the
	  text to flash, but text with the blink attribute can be displayed
	  in color, using new resources colorBL and colorBLMode.

	  <LI>If colors are not used, the blinking text will be displayed as
	  before (just like bold).  The main purpose of this is to make
	  applications work properly when they assume the emulator supports
	  blinking text.

	  <LI>I did this by moving the per-cell LINEWRAPPED flag to a per-line
	  flag, to make room for the new BLINK flag.  There were no per-line
	  flags, so this changes a lot of logic.
</UL>

	<LI>corrected missing save-cursor logic in the handling of SGR 1048
	  (the new control sequence I added in patch #54, 1997/10/17).
	  Reported by Darren Hiebert.

	<LI>flush the output of the transparent printing after each line
	  Reported by Tomas Vanhala &lt;vanhala@ling.helsinki.fi&gt;.

	<LI>correct the modes that are affected by save/restore cursor by adding
	  WRAPAROUND and PROTECTED.

	<LI>corrected placement of one of the XSync calls that I added in patch
	  #51, 1997/9/15, which had the side-effect of writing on the window
	  border when the xterm was resizing from 132 to 80 columns.

	<LI>work around an incompatibility of the XKB definition used in xterm
	  versus that symbol from IRIX 6.2's imake definitions (by adjusting
	  the standalone configure script).
</UL>

<H1><A NAME="xterm_59">Patch #59 - 1998/1/5 - XFree86 3.9Ab</A></H1>

My last patch has an off-by-one error in the comparison for argc.  Douglas
Kosovic &lt;douglask@dstc.edu.au&gt; showed me where (he got a core dump).
Also, I think this explains Clint Olsen's problem, but the symptoms were more
subtle (EINVAL for a system call if the -display option is omitted).

<H1><A NAME="xterm_58">Patch #58 - 1998/1/3 - XFree86 3.9Ab</A></H1>

This patch does the following:
<UL>
	<LI>implement logic to permit xterm to work with proportional fonts.
<UL>
	  <LI>Thomas Wolff
	  &lt;Thomas.Wolff@sietec.de&gt;
	  requested this (but it isn't exactly what he's asking
	  for - that's a more involved task).

	  <LI>I chose to do this by rendering the characters on a fixed pitch,
	  because it would not be useful for existing applications to display
	  varying numbers of characters on each line.

	  <LI>Except that this forces the display to be wider, it works reasonably
	  well.  A couple of special cases (reverse + colorBD, for example)
	  do not display with proper colors, since the inter-character gaps
	  are painted with the background.
</UL>

	<LI>added a version number to the program (several people have requested
	  this).

	<LI>make the -version and -help options interpreted before the program
	  attempts to open the display.

	<LI>minor reorganization of the man-page (ordered the options, resources
	  and translations alphabetically - and eliminated some duplication).

	<LI>corrected a misspelled filename in Makefile.in, and added a lint
	  rule.

	<LI>updated the configure script to correct behavior when it cannot
	  find imake, as well as to fix the IRIX+gcc build (conflict with
	  /usr/include).

	<LI>regenerated the configure script with a newer patch to autoconf
	  that fixes a problem with environment space vs the configure --help
	  message.
</UL>
<H1><A NAME="xterm_57">Patch #57 - 1997/12/26 - XFree86 3.9Aa</A></H1>

This patch is mostly concerned with the standalone configure script; a few
minor corrections are added:
<UL>
	<LI>add configure option --disable-tek4014, to allow xterm to be built
	  without the tek4014 emulation.

	<LI>add configure option --with-terminal-type, to allow xterm to be
	  compiled with default $TERM value other than "xterm" (e.g.,
	  "xterm-16color") -- requested by Stephen Marley &lt;stephen@memex.com&gt;.

	<LI>fix a typo in the configure --help message -- reported by Darren
	  Hiebert &lt;darren@hmi.com&gt;.

	<LI>review diffs between main.c and os2main.c, to make them more alike.
	  (applies some minor bugfixes to OS/2's version).

	<LI>add missing quotes in memmove/bcopy configure test
</UL>


<H1><A NAME="xterm_56">Patch #56 - 1997/11/28 - XFree86 3.9x</A></H1>

This patch is based on analysis by Arfst Ludwig &lt;arfst@luxor.IN-Berlin.DE&gt;,
who reported:
<dl>
<P>
	Setting the following resources xterm (all current versions) receives a
	segmentation fault on &lt;Btn2Up&gt; after scrolling:
<PRE>
	  *XTerm*VT100*translations:    #override \
	      ~Shift~Ctrl&lt;Btn2Up&gt;: insert-selection(PRIMARY, CUT_BUFFER0)\n\
	      Shift~Ctrl&lt;Btn2Up&gt;:  insert-selection(CLIPBOARD, CUT_BUFFER1)\n\
	      ~Shift&lt;BtnUp&gt;:       select-end(PRIMARY, CUT_BUFFER0)\n\
	      Shift&lt;BtnUp&gt;:        select-end(CLIPBOARD, CUT_BUFFER1)
</PRE>
	(The above resources intention is to be able to paste the latest
	selection even if the xterm was cleared.)
<P>
	And here is how it works (and a fix!):  The widget given to the action
	handler as first argument is not guaranteed to be a XtermWidget (it can
	be the ScrollbarWidget).  Instead of accessing the widget's member
	directly XtDisplay gives the required pointer in a safe way.
</dl>
I noticed that this was not the only instance (by reading the code, and testing
with his example), and extended the solution to check the widget-class to
ensure that it is indeed xterm's widget class before attempting to use it in
the context of translations.

<H1><A NAME="xterm_55">Patch #55 - 1997/11/25 - XFree86 3.9x</A></H1>

This fixes the segmentation violation noted by Rogier Wolff about a month
ago.  He'd set xterm to 400 (rows) by 150 columns, which broke because there
were limited buffers (200 rows) used for juggling data when adding or deleting
lines and for switching between alternate and normal screens.  I replaced this
by an allocated buffer.
<P>
The bug is simple to test if you set titeInhibit false.

<H1><A NAME="xterm_54">Patch #54 - 1997/10/17 - XFree86 3.9s</A></H1>

This patch does the following:
<UL>
	<LI>correct a minor placement problem with the right scrollbar.

	<LI>implement a new set of control sequences for switching between the
	  normal and alternate VT100 screens.  These work around the older
	  sequences limitation that required modification of the runtime
	  $TERMCAP to cooperate with the titeInhibit resource (that can't work
	  with terminfo).  I do this by moving all of the functionality of the
	  rmcur terminfo capability into the control sequences.

	<LI>implement the alternate-screen menu entry
</UL>

<H1><A NAME="xterm_53">Patch #53 - 1997/10/12 - XFree86 3.9r</A></H1>

This patch adds a fix and implements a new feature (as well as some minor
typos):
<UL>
	<LI>JCHANDRA@Inf.COM (JCHANDRA) noted that there was still a problem
	  with the wait call with the logging option.  It hung when the logfile
	  was opened as a command-line option.  I fixed this by moving the
	  StartLogging() call down past the place where I'd reset the setuid
	  mode.  So the logfile is opened as the real user, without having
	  to fork.

	<LI>Michael Rohleder &lt;michael.rohleder@stadt-frankfurt.de&gt; sent
	  me a patch which implements right-scrollbars for xterm.  I used that
	  as a starting point, renamed the command-line options and reduced
	  the number of ifdef's.
</UL>

<H1><A NAME="xterm_52">Patch #52 - 1997/9/29 - XFree86 3.9q</A></H1>

This patch addresses bugs and requests reported by
<UL>
	<LI>Bob Maynard &lt;rmaynard@montana.com&gt;,
	<LI>Clint Olsen &lt;olsenc@ichips.intel.com&gt;,
	<LI>JCHANDRA@Inf.COM (JCHANDRA),
	<LI>Michael Schroeder &lt;Michael.Schroeder@informatik.uni-erlangen.de&gt;,
	<LI>Pablo Ariel Kohan &lt;pablo@memco.co.il&gt;
</UL>

Some of the changes are interrelated (it was an unusually busy week).
<UL>

	<LI>change the default resource value for colorMode to true, matching
	  the Xterm.ad file.

	<LI>correct behavior of 'ech' control, making the default and 0
	  parameters erase one character rather than to the end of line
	  (reported by Michael Schroeder).

	<LI>add resource boldColors, command-line options +pc and -pc and
	  configure-script option to specify behavior of xterm's mapping bold
	  colors 0 through 7 to colors 8 through 15.
	  (request by Pablo Ariel Kohan).

	<LI>add resource colorAttrMode to specify whether colorULMode and
	  colorBDMode can override the ANSI colors
	  (from a problem report by Clint Olsen).

	<LI>correct a conflict between colorULMode/colorBDMode versus ANSI
	  colors, where exposure events would occasionally pick up the
	  former (e.g., colorBD) rather than ANSI colors.  Testing the
	  colorAttrMode made this apparent, though it has been in the
	  code since 3.2A (patch #35 in Jan 1997).

	<LI>correct two problems with the optional logging support.  On Linux
	  at least, the waitpid call in creat_as hangs when the logging is
	  toggled from the popup menu.  Also, the mktemp template has the wrong
	  number of X's (since X11R5!).  Fixed the waitpid problem by
	  exploiting the fact that the setuid behavior is reset before the
	  popup menus are available.
	  (reported by Jayachandran C.).

	<LI>add configure script options for building with the Xaw3d and neXtaw
	  libraries.

	<LI>correct CF_IMAKE_CFLAGS standalone configure script macro, so that it
	  will pick up $(ALLDEFINES) rather than $(STD_DEFINES).  This is
	  needed to make scrollbars work on Linux, since that uses narrow
	  prototypes.
	  (reported by Bob Maynard).

	<LI>various minor updates to configure-script macros.
</UL>

<H1><A NAME="xterm_51">Patch #51 - 1997/9/15 - XFree86 3.9p</A></H1>

Most of this patch is related to the standalone configure script, though
there are fixes/enhancements as well:
<UL>
	<LI>add a new resource sunKeyboard, with associated command-line
	  option and menu-toggle that allows using a normal Sun or PC
	  keyboard to generated the complete DEC-style function keys
	  and keypad.

	<LI>correct a reversed foreground/background test in the control
	  sequence that replies with the current SGR settings.

	<LI>correct, by invoking XSync, a display problem that caused the
	  program to not properly update newly exposed areas when a font
	  change or 80/132 resize request was not completely accepted.

	<LI>restructured autoconf macros (I made a library of all of the
	  macros across the complicated configure scripts I'm working on).

	<LI>use the autoconf config.guess and config.sub scripts to better
	  identify the host-os.

	<LI>improve the configure script that uses 'imake' as a fallback for
	  definitions.

	<LI>correct several instances of unsigned/signed mixed expressions.
</UL>

I've tested the configure script on Linux, SunOS 4.1.3, Solaris 2.5.1,
IRIX 5.2 and 6.2, AIX 3.2.5 and CLIX 3.1 (all but the last run properly
as well).

<H1><A NAME="xterm_50">Patch #50 - 1997/8/22 - XFree86 3.9m</A></H1>

This is a collection of small fixes, and a couple of minor enhancements:
<UL>
	<LI>plug a security hole in the implementation of Media Copy (print)
	  by invoking setuid just before the main loop.

	<LI>add an ifdef'd include for &lt;sys/termio.h&gt; for HP-UX, which allows
	  the program to process SIGWINCH events (this is a bug in X11R6.3)

	<LI>add state-table entries for VT52 emulation to enter/exit keypad
	  application mode.

	<LI>disable the popup-menu entry for 8-bit controls when the terminal-id
	  is less than 200 (e.g., VT52 or VT100).

	<LI>ensure that the popup-menu entry for 8-bit controls is updated when
	  the application enables/disables this mode, including the response
	  to a full-reset.

	<LI>implement VT300 DECBKM feature: set interpretation of the backarrow
	  key to either backspace or delete.  The initial setting is via
	  resource; it can also be modified in the main popup menu.

	<LI>implement VTxxx KAM (ISO AM), which allows a keyboard to be locked
	  (i.e., the terminal discards input).

	<LI>implement VTxxx SRM, which is used to control local echoing of
	  input on the terminal.

	<LI>add terminfo and termcap entries for xterm-8bit, a variation of
	  the xterm description that uses 8-bit control characters.

	<LI>add fallback definitions for Imakefile to allow it to work on some
	  X11R5 systems that have no SpecialCObjectRule or ProgramTargetName
	  macros.

	<LI>add .c.o and .c.i rules to standalone Makefile.in

	<LI>correct order of -lXmu and -lXext in standalone configure script.

	<LI>add configure script options to allow selective disabling of
	  active-icon, input-method and i18n code (mainly for users with X11R5
	  or an incomplete X11R6 configuration).

	<LI>change menu-indices from #define's to enum values, thereby making
	  it work better with the ifdef's for logging and active-icon (the
	  X11R6.3 active-icon code is incorrectly ifdef'd; this corrects an
	  error introduced by incorporating that code).

	<LI>correct minor compile errors in the configuration where active-icon
	  is not used.

	<LI>add configure option to suppress echoing of long compiler commands

	<LI>correct spelling of decTerminalID in configure script help message

	<LI>use gcc __attribute__((unused)) to quiet warnings about unused
	  parameters when compiling with -W (to make it simpler to find the
	  real problems).
</UL>

<H1><A NAME="xterm_49">Patch #49 - 1997/8/10 - XFree86 3.9k</A></H1>

sequences.

<H1><A NAME="xterm_48">Patch #48 - 1997/7/26 - XFree86 3.9j</A></H1>

This patch does the following (all but the first affect only the standalone
configure script):
<UL>
	<LI>minor correction to positioning of underlines for small (e.g., 5x8)
	  font size.
	<P>
	  The existing behavior allowed underlines to be drawn outside the
	  character-cell, so they weren't cleared properly under some
	  circumstances.

	<LI>adds more special-case tokens to the standalone configure script's
	  imake-option filter (e.g., "&&", since a "make -n main.o" on my IRIX
	  system uses that shell construct).

	<LI>adds a '--enable-logging' option for the standalone configure script.

	<LI>adds check and ifdef's for the standalone configure script to allow
	  for building on platforms with X11R6, which lacks Xpoll.h (introduced
	  in X11R6.1).
</UL>

<H1><A NAME="xterm_47">Patch #47 - 1997/7/13 - XFree86 3.9i</A></H1>

This patch does the following
<UL>
	<LI>corrects an indexing error in the doublesize character logic
	  (button.c) that caused core dump (this was reported by J.  Wunsch).
	<LI>corrects the logic of ShowCursor when it is painting in a doublesize
	  cell (charproc.c).
	<LI>corrects, according to vttest, the behavior when switching to
	  doublesize characters and back again (doublechr.c).
	<LI>adds cbt (back_tab) to the terminfo description (this was something
	  that I'd overlooked as applicable to curses optimization last
	  summer).
	<LI>corrects, for the standalone xmc test, the logic for disabling xmc.
</UL>

<H1><A NAME="xterm_46">Patch #46 - 1997/7/4 - XFree86 3.9h</A></H1>

This is a patch to provide test-support for some work I'm doing on ncurses.  It
does not modify the normal configuration of xterm; the code is compiled if the
standalone configure option "--enable-xmc-glitch" is specified.

<H1><A NAME="xterm_45">Patch #45 - 1997/7/2 - XFree86 3.9h</A></H1>

This fixes the problem reported with xterm's cursor color versus the background
(the second chunk in this patch) and also removes some duplicate initialization
of the cursor GC's.  If the cursor color at startup is the same as the
background, then xterm will use the reverse GC, ignoring the setting of the
colorMode resource.

<H1><A NAME="xterm_44">Patch #44 - 1997/6/22 - XFree86 3.9g</A></H1>

This implements the first part of the VT100 doublesize characters for xterm,
as well as fixing a handful of bugs:
<UL>
	<LI>the doublesize character support uses the normal font (using scaled
	  fonts will be another patch) with blanks to simulate doublesize
	  characters.  This patch does most of the global changes that'll be
	  required.  I've hidden most of the details in macros and ifdefs so
	  it's easy to configure out (part of the patch is a configure option
	  for that purpose).

	<LI>corrected limits in DeleteChar() function -- it's always ignored the
	  size of the left border and scrollbar.  I noticed this when working
	  on the doublesize characters since the glitch was doubled in size
	  (i.e., it wrapped some garbage around the right margin).

	<LI>corrected 'memmove()' logic, for standalone builds (it referenced a
	  malloc wrapper from my development library).

	<LI>add a check for HideCursor() to prevent repeated screen updates
	  (which can cause a spurious cursor glitch to appear, e.g., during
	  scrolling).  I noticed this with the 3.2A version (but only a few
	  weeks ago, when I started working on this patch).
</UL>

<H1><A NAME="xterm_43">Patch #43 - 1997/6/10 - XFree86 3.9d</A></H1>

Here's a fix for two problems:
<UL>
	<LI>modify handling of tgetent results in xterm and resize programs to
	  make them tolerant of missing termcap file, or unknown terminal name.
	  In this scheme, an explicit "-tn" option will succeed, overriding
	  the fallback list.

	<LI>a nit in the configure script (log extra information to help diagnose
	  which case of the test-compile of tgetent was used).
</UL>

<H1><A NAME="xterm_42">Patch #42 - 1997/6/8 - XFree86 3.2Xl</A></H1>

Bram Moolenaar reported that the cursor color changed unexpectedly while
scrolling.  The cause was that it used the same GC's as the logic that draws
the ANSI colors.  The bug only appears if the cursorColor resource isn't set,
and has been present since the initial implementation early last year.  (The
same bug also appears in rxvt ;-).  Here's a fix.

<H1><A NAME="xterm_41">Patch #41 - 1997/5/28 - XFree86 3.2Xl</A></H1>

Some nits found by Darren Hiebert (missing part of install-rule, incorrect
assignment for --enable-color-mode option).

<H1><A NAME="xterm_40">Patch #40 - 1997/5/26 - XFree86 3.2Xl</A></H1>

Patch for the configure script's logic for obtaining imake predefined
symbols.

<H1><A NAME="xterm_39">Patch #39 - 1997/5/24 - XFree86 3.2Xl</A></H1>

This patch does the following:
<UL>
	<LI>integrate the 16-color change for 'xterm'

	<LI>minor fixes/clarification of tgetent in terminfo vs termcap to
	  'resize'
</UL>

(both changes also modify the configure script)

<H1><A NAME="xterm_38">Patch #38 - 1997/5/22 - XFree86 3.2Xh</A></H1>

This implements a simple configuration script with autoconf (to which I'll
add more options later).  It does the following:
<UL>
	<LI>configures xterm to build with X11R5 (at least on SunOS 4.1, Solaris
	  2.4, possibly IRIX - sorry network was down today, but I did test
	  an earlier version yesterday).

	<LI>enables/disables the configuration ifdefs for ANSI color and VT52
	  emulation.
</UL>
It does not make tests for the things that imake does (that's another project),
instead it uses a hybrid of the autoconf tests for libraries and adds imake's
compiler options (which are necessary in some cases to get main.c to compile).

<H1><A NAME="xterm_37">Patch #37 - 1997/5/7 - XFree86 3.9a</A></H1>

This corrects a minor, but annoying error in the vt220 emulation: the DECUDK
is only supposed to be interpreted for _shifted_ function keys.

<H1><A NAME="xterm_36">Patch #36 - 1997/1/16 - XFree86 3.2r</A></H1>

This corrects something that I overlooked in patch #27 (21-aug-1996), which is
that when trimming the region to be repainted for the highlightSelection
resource of xterm, I still have to paint the background past the highlighted
region.  This only happens when I first do a selection in a window that's
partly off-screen, then move the window on-screen.

<H1><A NAME="xterm_35">Patch #35 - 1997/1/7 - XFree86 3.2o</A></H1>

This patch does the following:
<UL>
	<LI>combines the coding for foreground and background colors into a
	  single byte, reducing the memory required to store saved-lines in
	  color.  (I'll take back that byte in a following patch to use to
	  ensure the character-set, so there's no long-term decrease in memory
	  use).

	<LI>modifies the PF1-PF4 coding in termcap/terminfo.  Because xterm is
	  still by default emulating vt100, the function key codes are
	  vt100-compatible (I overlooked this in patch #31).

	  I also reformatted the whole terminfo file into a single-column,
	  for consistency.

	<LI>adds an interim xterm-vt220 description to accommodate the old and new
	  styles of function-keys (though probably it'd be better to drop the
	  old-style altogether).
</UL>

<H1><A NAME="xterm_34">Patch #34 - 1997/1/5 - XFree86 3.2o</A></H1>

This patch does the following:
<UL>
	<LI>implement DECSTR (soft terminal reset).  The biggest diff is due to
	  adding another state table (note that there's only one useful state
	  here, but it's only 256 bytes rather than 1k as it would have been
	  before I reduced the size of state entries).

	<LI>some minor tidying up (e.g., signed/unsigned use bitcpy, MODE_DECCKM,
	  resetColor, resetCharsets).  More is done in patch #35.
</UL>

I got the description of DECSTR from a vt420 user's manual.  I'll do some
testing with vttest to ensure that there's nothing else to do than what was
documented.

<H1><A NAME="xterm_33">Patch #33 - 1996/11/24 - XFree86 3.2</A></H1>

This adds to the reset-fix by Matthieu Herrb &lt;Mathieu.Herrb@mipnet.fr&gt; a
small change to make xterm able to output 8-bit characters in VT100 mode.

Applications that run on real VT100's don't do that anyway, and this feature
should be removed sometime after finishing off the VT220 emulation (VT220's can
do 8-bit characters).  That would be a good time to change the default
terminal-id to 220.

<H1><A NAME="xterm_32">Patch #32 - 1996/11/21 - XFree86 3.2</A></H1>

This implements the REP (repeat) control for xterm.  That isn't part of the DEC
VTxxx series, but is defined in ISO 6429.  (Note that the base xterm terminal
description is <EM>not</EM> changed -- I added a variant, "xterm-rep").

<H1><A NAME="xterm_31">Patch #31 - 1996/11/16 - XFree86 3.2</A></H1>

This implements vt52 emulation in xterm (ifdef'd so it can be removed).
I've been using it for testing for the past month or so.

<H1><A NAME="xterm_30">Patch #30 - 1996/11/16 - XFree86 3.2</A></H1>

From bug-report by &lt;auroux@clipper.ens.fr&gt; (Denis Auroux), missing reset to
ground state.  I checked through the rest of <EM>that</EM> table and found another,
in the unimplemented MC (screen print).

<H1><A NAME="xterm_29">Patch #29 - 1996/9/15 - XFree86 3.1.2Gb</A></H1>

This patch does the following:
<UL>
	<LI>corrects the restoration of color for bold/underline color mode

	<LI>adds a resource 'decTerminalID' to control the reporting level of
	  xterm (e.g., VT100, VT220).

	<LI>uses the new resource to implement/correct the DA1, DA2 and
	  DECRPTUI reports.

	<LI>change valid-response code in DECRQSS from 0 to 1 (the manual says 0,
	  but the VT420 terminal I've been testing on says 1).
</UL>

All of these changes are based on vttest 2.6
<P>
(Most of the volume in the patch is to add 2 more state tables for parsing
the 2nd/3rd device-attribute controls).

<H1><A NAME="xterm_28">Patch #28 - 1996/8/31 - XFree86 3.1.2F</A></H1>

This patch corrects the following reported by Roland Rosenfeld
&lt;roland@spinnaker.rhein.de&gt;:
<UL>
	<LI>handle SGR 22, 24 and 25 in combination with colorUL and colorBD
	  resources.  Also noted & fixed reset of colored underline/bold
	  with SGR 0.

	<LI>a typo in the termcap (missing '['), from 3.1.2Dj (my error)

<PRE>
	-adobe-courier-bold-r-normal--12-120-75-75-m-70-iso8859-1

<H1><A NAME="xterm_27">Patch #27 - 1996/8/21 - XFree86 3.1.2Ek</A></H1>

This patch fixes one of my long-term gripes:  xterm's selection doesn't clearly

<H1><A NAME="xterm_26">Patch #26 - 1996/8/20 - XFree86 3.1.2Ei</A></H1>

Here's a patch to fix a problem with xterm's cut/paste and another to modify

<H1><A NAME="xterm_25">Patch #25 - 1996/8/18 - XFree86 3.1.2Ei</A></H1>

Here's a correction for two minor bugs that I picked up in testing, plus

<UL>
	<LI>make the second alternate font the same as the first (that's what
	  vt420 and dtterm do)

	<LI>corrected DECSCL report when DECSCL hasn't been set (i.e., don't

</UL>

<H1><A NAME="xterm_24">Patch #24 - 1996/8/11 - XFree86 3.1.2Ee</A></H1>

This patch does several things.  In effect, xterm can (I think) do a reasonably
good job of emulating vt220 and vt320 terminals (as well as it was doing
vt100, at any rate ;-).
<P>
It does NOT do:
<UL>
	<LI>soft fonts

	<LI>rigel or sixel graphics

<P>
Anyway, I:
<UL>

	<LI>added ECH, CPL, CNL, SU, SD, CBT, CHT controls

	<LI>added popup-menu for switching between DEC and Sun function keys.
	  (corrected alignment err wrt logging entry at that point).

	<LI>make xterm recognize both 8-bit and 7-bit controls (including
	  popup menu for switching modes).

	<LI>add user-definable function keys (aka DECUDK)

	<LI>support concealed text

	<LI>support protected text (both ISO compatible and DEC compatible -
	  that's not the same thing, btw), with SPA, EPA, DECSCA, DECSED,
	  DECSEL controls.

	<LI>implement DECSCL.
</UL>
<P>
I'll be continuing to test this patch for a while, but don't expect to add any

reverse video.  However, I did see that the original_fg and original_bg data
weren't really used - so I removed that logic.
<P>
Also:
<UL>
	<LI>during initialization, check if ANSI colors are set with non fg/bg

<H1><A NAME="xterm_19">Patch #19 - 1996/7/21 - XFree86 3.1.2Ec</A></H1>

This patch does the following:
<UL>
	<LI>fixes the core dump that I reported on IRIX 5.2 (in main.c)
	<P>
	  (it's worth noting that this bug exists in X11R6.1, so I'd like
	  to assume that someone's already submitted a fix to X Consortium...)

	<LI>change the interpretation of zero rows or columns in a resize-window
	  request to use the root window's size (looking more carefully at
	  dtterm, that seems to be what it does).

	<LI>change some memmove calls to memcpy for slightly better performance.
	  (also, a couple of memset calls to bzero - Quantify says bzero runs
	  20% faster, I assume because there's one less argument).

	<LI>interpret character sets 1 and 2 (so that vttest gives a reasonable
	  result) Both rxvt and dtterm do something equivalent.

	<LI>fix a minor memory leak in the logic that retrieves the window or
	  icon names (Purify found this for me while I ran vttest).
</UL>

<H1><A NAME="xterm_18">Patch #18 - 1996/7/18 - XFree86 3.1.2Ec</A></H1>

This implements the following:
<UL>
	<LI>escape sequences that act like the CDE dtterm's window operations
	  (though I have implemented the default width and height -- I've seen
	  a rather buggy dtterm running that seems to treat width=0 or height=0
	  literally -- maybe that's a feature, not a bug?)

	<LI>minor tweak to the screen-repainting when resizing (I still cannot
	  entirely get rid of flicker).

	<LI>still more fixes to terminfo & termcap (I corrected my error for
	  the hpa code and added some other stuff by comparing to ncurses'
	  description and rxvt's).

	<LI>a tweak to the patch by Michael Rohleder for the color translation

	<LI>re-order attribute codes to allow later implementation of protected
	  fields (dtterm supposedly does this; it's probably more useful than
	  blinking or invisible text -- that uses up all of the available bits
	  without changing the attribute scheme radically).
</UL>

<H1><A NAME="xterm_17">Patch #17 - 1996/7/2 - XFree86 3.1.2Eb</A></H1>

This patch implements for xterm several minor features from ISO 6429 which are
useful for terminfo applications.  The HPA and VPA control sequences allow
cursor movement along a row or column, cutting down a little on the characters
transmitted.  The other codes allow resetting specific graphic rendition
attributes without modifying the other attributes.

(now if someone just had time to implement blinking cursors...)

<H1><A NAME="xterm_16">Patch #16 - 1996/6/25 - XFree86 3.1.2Ea</A></H1>

Adam Tla/lka &lt;atlka@pg.gda.pl&gt; told me a couple of weeks ago that I'd missed
some of the background coloring in xterm.  I investigated, and found that while
I'd picked up on the clear-to-bottom and clear-to-end-of-line operations, I'd
overlooked the insert/delete lines.  Just so I wouldn't overlook any more of
these, I updated a copy of vttest to test ISO colors and bce (background color
erase).  This patch introduces a new function, ClearCurBackground, whose calls
replace the direct XClearArea calls that I'd overlooked.

(There's also a few compiler warnings fixed, etc ;-)

<H1><A NAME="xterm_15">Patch #15 - 1996/5/29 - XFree86 3.1.2E</A></H1>

This fixes the problem reported by David Dawes, by making the 50msec select
timeout for the Xaw3d arrow scrollbar a resource.  (I made it a boolean for a
variety of reasons -- to make it a number, you'd need an additional resource,
to avoid breaking the logic).

<H1><A NAME="xterm_14">Patch #14 - 1996/5/12 - XFree86 3.1.2Dj</A></H1>

This patch brings the termcap and terminfo descriptions for xterm up to date.
I made the following changes:
<UL>
	<LI>reformatted the terminfo description in a single-column (this is ok
	  for terminfo, and will simplify future patches -- can't do that for
	  termcap, since it would impact buffer requirements on some systems).

	<LI>omitted obsolete features in termcap to save a little space (bs, pt)

	<LI>added color capabilities to termcap (ut, Co, NC, op, AB, AF)

	<LI>corrected some capabilities (vi, ve)

	<LI>added 'st' (set tab)

	<LI>reduced function keys in termcap for 'xterm' to 12 because color
	  capabilities makes that description larger than 1023 characters.

	<LI>created new termcap name 'xtermm' (monochrome) to match the terminfo
	  list, and make that description have 20 function keys.

	<LI>added corresponding color capabilities to terminfo (bce, colors,
	  pairs, op, ncv, setab, setaf)

	<LI>corrected corresponding capabilities in terminfo (civis, cnorm,
	  rmcup, smcup)

	<LI>added capabilities (el1, hts)

	<LI>in both, corrected home/end keys to match the code correction made
	  by Thomas Mueller in 3.1.2Bk

	  =&gt; (I'm still considering modifying the code & description to match
	      the rxvt program).
</UL>

<H1><A NAME="xterm_13">Patch #13 - 1996/4/23 - XFree86 3.1.2Df</A></H1>

This corrects my earlier changes for colors - the inner border of the xterm was
getting painted with the wrong color, since I'd moved the call to set the
background into the logic that tracks SGR information.

<H1><A NAME="xterm_12">Patch #12 - 1996/3/16 - XFree86 3.1.2Dc</A></H1>

This corrects a memory leak in xterm that happens whenever one switches fonts.

<H1><A NAME="xterm_11">Patch #11 - 1996/3/5 - XFree86 3.1.2Db</A></H1>

This patch corrects the behavior of the ANSI colors in xterm when reverse
video is used, as well as some other lesser sins:
<UL>
	<LI>button.c
<UL>
		<LI>(compiler warnings: shadowing of 'time', redundant cast)
</UL>

	<LI>charproc.c
<UL>
		<LI>renamed screen.colors[] array to screen.Acolors[] to more
		easily distinguish the non-ANSI colors from the ANSI colors.

		<LI>moved logic of SGR_Save() into VTInitialize, getting rid of
		local private variables original_fg and original_bg.

		<LI>moved some logic into getXtermForeground and getXtermBackground
		from SGR_Foreground, SGR_Background, etc.

		<LI>corrected misleading 'row' to 'col' in case for CUF, CUB
		sequences.
</UL>

	<LI>ctlseqs.ms
	<LI>xterm.man
<UL>
		<LI>(correct a misconception which I'd added that the color0
		through color6 resource values apply to non-ANSI colors)
</UL>

	<LI>ptyx.h
<UL>
		<LI>added original_fg, original_bg to TScreen structure.
</UL>

	<LI>scrollbar.c
<UL>
		<LI>(compiler warnings: redundant cast)
</UL>

	<LI>util.c
<UL>
		<LI>new functions getXtermForeground and getXtermBackground replace
		the macros GET_FG and GET_BG, with the added functionality of
		checking for the reverse-video status of xterm.

		<LI>in ReverseVideo, swap the SGR foreground and background colors
		also.
</UL>
</UL>

<H1><A NAME="xterm_10">Patch #10 - 1996/2/14 - XFree86 3.1.2Cd</A></H1>

I observed an occasional glitch in the xterm's color behavior; a clear to end
of line would get a color that had been used in a program that supposedly reset
colors.  I traced this down to the way xterm was modifying colors of GC's on
the fly; it didn't restore the original color of the GC, even though it would
later be used in functions (such as ClearRight) that assumed (my error) that
the GC would have the current foreground or background color.
<P>
I fixed this by resetting the GC's colors with a new function 'resetXtermGC()',
and direct calls on SGR_Foreground/SGR_Background, as appropriate and using a
new function 'updatedXtermGC()' to encapsulate the logic that modifies the GC's
color.  (I also removed some commented-out code that was trying to do this --
the problem was a little more obscure).

<H1><A NAME="xterm_09">Patch #9 - 1996/2/10 - XFree86 3.1.2Cb</A></H1>

This patch fixes the remaining problems that I had making xterm run with x11r5,
as well as a couple of other bugs.  It follows my patch from yesterday, that
added ifdef's for some of the input-method resources.
<UL>
	<LI>corrected ifdef's that suppress the input-method code (doesn't
	  exist in my x11r5, and xterm works adequately without it).

	<LI>corrected fallback definition for 'Select()' macro (oops: I'd
	  copied the wrong text...)

	<LI>moved the declarations for the fd_set variables to data.[ch]

	<LI>corrected an ifdef in resize.c (sunos 4.x doesn't have termcap.h)

	<LI>corrected (in main.c) some unused/orphaned variables.
</UL>

<H1><A NAME="xterm_08">Patch #8 - 1996/2/9 - XFree86 3.1.2Cb</A></H1>

This is mostly a documentation patch for xterm.  It describes the color control
sequences in more detail, and documents some other features of xterm that
aren't described elsewhere.
<P>
I've also added a couple of ifdef's to fix (part of) the problem that I'm
working on (making the program work properly on x11r5, where I'm doing memory
testing -- I have a "good" version from mid-January, but my resync version
doesn't work properly on x11r5).  I'm not done with <EM>that</EM> yet.

<H1><A NAME="xterm_07">Patch #7 - 1996/1/28 - XFree86 3.1.2n</A></H1>

I did a (clean) build of 3.1.2n on Linux 1.2.13 (ELF).  I've got an S3 card.
<P>
This fixes the following in the 3.1.2n xterm:
<UL>
	<LI>initialize cur_foreground, cur_background in charproc.c (Purify
	  told me they weren't initialized).

	<LI>add interpretation of codes 39, 49, to reset background and
	  foreground to default value (I'm told that ISO 6429 does this; but I
	  don't have a written reference -- yet -- can anyone help here?).
	  Anyway, rxvt does it, and it'll solve my remaining color management
	  problems.

	<LI>shadowing of 'time' in menu.c

	<LI>'Cardinal' vs 'int' in scrollbar.c

	<LI>several changes to permit compile with X11R5 (the system that I've
	  got Purify on won't be upgraded to X11R6 for a long time).
</UL>
<P>
I built this version (with a minor nit that I'll patch soon) on SunOS 4.1.3 so
that I can test it some more with Purify.
<P>
<EM>btw</EM>:
the changes made in Xpoll.h won't work on some older systems, because
	fd_set isn't a defined type (I've got one machine at least that this
	applies to).

<H1><A NAME="xterm_06">Patch #6 - 1996/1/8</A></H1>

This patch does all of the SGR foreground/background fixes (i.e., clearing the
screen after an SGR color is set causes that color to be used in the foreground
and/or background).  If the FG_COLOR and/or BG_COLOR flags aren't set, then the
xterm foreground and background default to the window's values.  This usage is
consistent with various types of hardware (especially the IBM PC), and is also
used in rxvt.
<UL>
	<LI>charproc.c:
<UL>
		<LI>add/use new macros GET_FG, GET_BG - n/c.

		<LI>add/use new functions SGR_Foreground() and SGR_Background()
		  to set corresponding colors in GC's, and to retain sense of
		  "original" colors.

		  <P>
		  =&gt; This makes redundant some of the corresponding logic
		     in HideCursor to set the foreground and background,
		     but I left it in since it <EM>may</EM> be fixing an unrelated
		     requirement.

		<LI>set GC's in LoadNewFont() according to whether the SGR fg/bg
		  colors are active.

		  <P>
		  =&gt; This fixes some glitches in the accompanying resize,
		     that leaves parts of the window in the original
		     background color.
</UL>

	<LI>screen.c:
<UL>
		<LI>modified ClearBufRows() to use the SGR fg/bg colors if
		  they're set.

		<LI>added function ScrnClearLines(), used this to replace
		  portions of ScrnInsertLine() and ScrnDeleteLine().
		  The new function uses the SGR fg/bg colors if they're
		  set.

		  <P>
		  =&gt; Otherwise, selection after an index or reverse index will
		     paint the wrong colors.

		<LI>modified ScrnDeleteChar() and ScrnInsertChar()
		  to use SGR fg/bg colors.
</UL>

	<LI>util.c:
<UL>
		<LI>modified ClearRight() so that if either of the SGR fg/bg
		  colors is set, we don't bzero the attributes and color
		  arrays, but instead fill them with the appropriate codes.

		<LI>modified ClearLeft to use SGR fg/bg colors.
</UL>
</UL>

<H1><A NAME="xterm_05">Patch #5 - 1996/1/7</A></H1>

This patch modifies the object code, by replacing indexing expressions with
temporary variables with the full indexing expression.  At first glance, this
seems inefficient (it did to me ;-), until remembering comments made in the
compilers newsgroups that trying to "help" the compiler doesn't really work
that well.  A good optimizing compiler can do a better job than the programmer
can.  (There's a moral in the use of 'register' variables also, but I won't fix
those...).

Anyway, the revised code generates a smaller object...

This is my third (and final cleanup) patch for xterm.  It gets rid of the

At this point, the only compile warnings I've got (on Linux) are those about

This is my second patch to xterm.  It corrects most of the gcc warnings (except
for some that are due to X header files ;-).  I compared objects to keep track

<P>
At this point, I'm compiling (fairly) clean with gcc options
<PRE>
	-Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -Wmissing-prototypes -Wshadow -Wnested-externs

<H1><A NAME="xterm_01">Patch #1 - 1996/1/6</A></H1>
This is my first cleanup patch for xterm.  It addresses all of the gcc warnings
for -Wall, -Wmissing-prototypes and -Wstrict-prototypes that I can change
without modifying the object code.  (I'm compiling this with gcc 2.7.0 for an
aout target, which makes it simple to compare objects.  When I do ELF-only,
I've got a tool that compares that sort of thing as well).
<P>
Briefly, this patch adds (and uses) two header files in the xterm directory:
<PRE>
	proto.h
	xterm.h
</PRE>
I expect this to be the biggest patch by far.  However (barring a misplaced
prototype), it shouldn't break anything, since the intent of the patch is to
provide missing declarations.
