<title>Release Notes for XFree86&tm; 3.3.7
<author>The XFree86 Project, Inc
<date>15 February 2000

<abstract>

This document describes the bugs fixed and the features added in
XFree86 3.3.7 compared with the 3.3.6 release, 
It also includes installation instructions for the binary distributions.
It is strongly recommended that anyone using XFree86 update to version
3.3.7. 

</abstract>

<toc>

<sect> XFree86 and X11R6.3
<p>
XFree86 releases starting with the 3.2A beta are based on the
X Consortium's X11R6.3 (the final release from the X Consortium).

R6.3 is an update to R6.1, and is intended to be compatible with R6.1
and R6 at the source and protocol levels.  Binaries should be
upward-compatible.  X11R6.3 includes some new Xserver extensions:
SECURITY, XC-APPGROUP, XpExtension (print extension), and an updated,
and standardised version of LBX.  X11R6.3 also has new standards,
including RX (X Remote Execution MIME type), and a proxy management
protocol.  X11R6.3 includes support for gzipped fonts.

R6.1 is an update to R6,
and is intended to be compatible with R6 at the source and protocol
levels.  Binaries should be upward-compatible.  X11R6.1 includes some
new Xserver extensions: DOUBLE-BUFFER, XKEYBOARD and RECORD.

What about R6.2?  X11R6.2 is the name given to a subset of X11R6.3,
which has only the print extension and the Xlib implementation of
vertical writing and user-defined character support in addition to
those features included in R6.1.
<p>
<sect> X11R6.4
<p>
In September 1998 The Open Group changed the copyright of X11R6.4
from the non-free copyright used for the initial release of
X11R6.4 back to the old free X Consortium style copyright.
Given the fact that our main development focus is on XFree86-4.0 and that 
the 3.3.x releases are intended mostly to fix some bugs and get out new
drivers to the public, we opted not to include X11R6.4 in XFree86-3.3.x.
<p>
XFree86-4.0 will be X11R6.4 based.
<p>
<sect> OS issues
<p>
Always check the OS specific README files for special requirements or caveats. 
<p>
Users running Linux should note that Elf is now the only binary type 
supported for Linux OSs.  This means
that binaries for ix86/a.out and AXP/ECOFF are not available with this
release.
<p>
Users running FreeBSD 3.0 should note that only ELF binaries are provided
with this release.  a.out shared libraries are also included for compatibility
purposes.

<sect1>Known Problems
<p>
The problems listed here are those known at the time of the release.  See
the <htmlurl name="XFree86 FAQ" url="http://www.xfree86.org/FAQ"> for more
up to date information.
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>There are problems with some Cirrus laptop chipsets (75xx).  The
	driver seems to work for some people, but not others.  Until
	someone with the appropriate hardware can look into
	this, these problems are unlikely to be fixed.  If you wish to
	work on this, please contact us.  We don't need testers, we need
	people willing and able to fix the problems.
  <item>There are problems with some of the Trident laptop chipsets.  The
	driver seems to work in a limited way for some people, but not
	others.  Until someone with the appropriate hardware can look into
	this, these problems are unlikely to be fixed.  If you wish to
	work on this, please contact us.  We don't need testers, we need
	people willing and able to fix the problems.
  <item>SuperProbe command fails to detect some newly supported chips.
        Currently, the probing result with Xserver itself with appropriate
        setting in XF86Config (and maybe option "-probeonly") can be more
        relied on than the result from SuperProbe for newer chips.
        If you are interested in improving the design of SuperProbe's code,
        let's come and join as the member of the XFree86 ``developer team''.
</itemize>

<sect>XFree86 and Open Source Software
<p>
XFree86 public releases in general follow the Open Source Software definition
as set forth at <htmlurl name="http://www.opensource.org/osd.html"
url="http://www.opensource.org/osd.html">. 
This definition is actually a subset of our requirements.
<p>
All code in XFree86 3.3.7 satisfies the Open Source Software definition.
<p>

<sect>Installing the XFree86 3.3.7 Release
<p>
The XFree86 3.3.7 binaries are distributed as a full release.
<!--
, and as an
update to the 3.3.6 release.  For information about upgrading from 3.3.6
to 3.3.7 see section <ref id="upgrade"
name="Updating XFree86 3.3.6 to XFree86 3.3.7">.
-->

NOTE: the X servers are no longer installed setuid root.  If you are
starting your X servers with startx/xinit, or something similar, you
will need a copy of the setuid Xwrapper, and an updated xinit.  These
can be found in Xbin.tgz.

What follows is a list of the XFree86 3.3.7 components.  There may be
some variations in this for some OSs.

The following are required for all new installations, or when upgrading
from a version older than 3.3:
<quote>
<verb>
preinst.sh      Pre-installation script
postinst.sh     Post-installation script
extract         XFree86 extraction utility
Xbin.tgz        Clients, run-time libs, and app-defaults files
Xdoc.tgz        Documentation
Xfnts.tgz       75dpi, misc and PEX fonts
Xlib.tgz        Data files required at run-time
Xman.tgz        Manual pages
Xset.tgz        XF86Setup utility
Xjset.tgz       XF86Setup utility (if you prefer the Japanese version)
XVG16.tgz       16 colour VGA server (XF86Setup needs this server)
Xcfg.tgz        sample config files for xinit, xdm
</verb>
</quote>

The following are required when upgrading from version 3.3 or later:

<quote>
<verb>
preinst.sh      Pre-installation script
postinst.sh     Post-installation script
extract         XFree86 extraction utility
Xbin.tgz        Clients, run-time libs, and app-defaults files
Xdoc.tgz        Documentation
Xlib.tgz        Data files required at run-time
Xman.tgz        Manual pages
Xset.tgz        XF86Setup utility
Xjset.tgz       XF86Setup utility (if you prefer the Japanese version)
XVG16.tgz       16 colour VGA server (XF86Setup needs this server)
</verb>
</quote>

While it isn't essential to update the standard fonts, this version does
include some minor fixes to some of them, as well as the addition of
two basic ISO 8859-15 fonts.  If you want to upgrade the standard fonts you
will also need:

<quote>
<verb>
Xfnts.tgz       75dpi, misc and PEX fonts
</verb>
</quote>

NOTE: Be very careful about installing Xcfg.tgz over an existing
installation if you have customised your xinit and/or xdm config files.
Installing Xcfg.tgz will overwrite any existing files.  If you do have
customised files, there is no need to install Xcfg.tgz.

NOTE: The bitmap fonts distributed with this release are compressed using
gzip rather than compress.  This means that you will probably want to
remove the old versions (after backing them up).  The Xservers and font
server in releases prior to 3.2A cannot read gzipped fonts, so keep a copy
of the old fonts if you wish to run older servers.

The following X servers are for PC/AT based hardware (i.e., typical
Intel ix86 based PCs).  Choose at least one which
matches your hardware, as well as the VGA16 server.  The VGA16 server is
required by the new configuration utility (XF86Setup).
A list showing which X server is required for a range of video cards can
be found at <htmlurl name="http://www.xfree86.org/cardlist.html"
url="http://www.xfree86.org/cardlist.html">.

The following X servers are for PC98 hardware. Note that PC98 is a 
Japanese computer standard and has nothing to do with Win98, or the 
Intel and Microsoft PC98 specification. If you have a PC98 machine,
choose one which suits your hardware.  If you don't know what a PC98 machine
is, you don't need any of these.  These servers <bf>will not run</bf>
on "normal" PCs, so don't even try them if you don't have a Japanese PC98
machine.

If you already have a version of XFree86 installed, <bf>MAKE A BACKUP OF</bf>
<tt>/usr/X11R6</tt> <bf>BEFORE DOING ANYTHING ELSE</bf>.  The standard
installation procedure will overwrite your existing version of XFree86.

If you are installing from scratch, create a directory called
<tt>/usr/X11R6</tt>, then extract the required <tt>.tgz</tt> files.
If you don't have enough space in <tt>/usr</tt> for this, create a
directory elsewhere and create a symbolic link to it.
E.g., if you create a directory in <tt>/home</tt>:
<tscreen><verb>
	mkdir /home/X11R6
	ln -s /home/X11R6 /usr
</verb></tscreen>

The next step is to run the pre-installation script.  This script makes
some preliminary checks of your system.  For some OSs, it may tell you
to install new versions of some system components before proceeding with
the installation.  This script may also remove some outdated files and
symbolic links from a previous installation that could cause problems.

For the purposes of these installation instructions, it is assumed that
you have downloaded all the files to the <tt>/var/tmp</tt> directory.
If you've put them in another directory, that's fine -- just replace
all occurrences of ``<tt>/var/tmp</tt>'' with the name of that directory.

To run the pre-installation script, go to <tt>/usr/X11R6</tt> and run it:
<tscreen><verb>
	cd /usr/X11R6
	sh /var/tmp/preinst.sh
</verb></tscreen>

The next step is to make the installation utility executable.  To do this,
make sure the `extract' file is in the same directory as all the X*.tgz
files, and run the following from that directory:

<tscreen><verb>
	chmod 755 extract
</verb></tscreen>

The installation utility ``extract'' is used to unpack the .tgz files
that make up the XFree86 distribution.  The .tgz files are gzipped
tar files.  However, ``tar'' in its standard form on most OSs is not
well-suited to the task of installing XFree86.  The extract utility is
a modified version of GNU tar 1.12 built with the options required to
make it suitable for installing XFree86.  The source for extract is
available from the same place you got the XFree86 distribution.

It is strongly recommended that you use the provided extract utility to
unpack the XFree86 distribution.  If you choose to ignore this and use
something else, we don't want to hear from you if you run into problems.
It is also important that you do not rename the extract utility.  If
renamed, it behaves just like the normal GNU tar.

To extract the XFree86 binaries, run the following as <bf>root</bf>:
<tscreen><verb>
	cd /usr/X11R6
	/var/tmp/extract /var/tmp/X*.tgz
</verb></tscreen>

Once the required <tt>.tgz</tt> files have been extracted, run the post
installation script:
<tscreen><verb>
	cd /usr/X11R6
	sh /var/tmp/postinst.sh
</verb></tscreen>

For OSs which use ldconfig, you may need to run ldconfig or reboot to
complete the installation.  The postinst.sh script should run ldconfig
correctly for you if you are using Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD or OpenBSD.
For other OSs that use ldconfig, check how it normally gets run at boot time.

Once the installation is complete, you should run the one of the
configuration utilities (<tt>XF86Setup</tt> or <tt>xf86config</tt>) to
configure the X server.  This is essential for a new installation but
optional for an existing installation.  Refer to the
<htmlurl name="QuickStart document" url="QuickStart.html"> for configuration
information.
