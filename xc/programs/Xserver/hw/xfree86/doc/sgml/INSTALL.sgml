<title>Installation Guide for XFree86 3.2
<author>David Dawes
<Date>24 October 1996

<abstract>
This document describes how to build XFree86 from the <bf>source</bf>
distribution.  It covers building from the full source distribution as
well as from the cut-down source distribution available for building
only the X servers.  It is designed to
be used in conjunction with the OS-specific README files.  This document
does <bf>not</bf> describe how to install or upgrade a binary
distribution.  That information is contained either in the
<htmlurl name=RELNOTES url=RELNOTES.html>, OS-specific
README files, or in separate documentation accompanying the various binary
distributions.

<sect>Building XFree86 From a Source Distribution

<p>
<quote>
<bf/NOTE:/  Refer to the appropriate OS-specific README file before attempting
       to build XFree86.  These files contain additional information that 
       you may need to successfully build under your OS.

We highly recommend using GCC-2 to build XFree86.  Do not use version
2.6.0 or 2.4.x versions prior to 2.4.5 due to bugs that cause either
build or execution failures.
Use of GCC's -m486 option will yield
approximately 5&percnt; better performance on a 486, with no degradation (other
than larger binaries) on a 386.  (gcc-2 is available from prep.ai.mit.edu
and other sites archiving GNU source.)

<enum>
<item>You need the following:

    <itemize>
    <item> X Consortium X11R6.1 distribution with fix 01 applied.

    <item> <tt/R6.1pl1-3.2.diff.gz/, <tt/cfont32.tgz/

    <item> Optionally the X Consortium X11R6.1 contrib distribution.

    <item> <tt/contrib-3.2.diff.gz/ (an optional patch for
              some of the X Consortium's ``contrib'' distribution)

    <item> If you want to only build the XFree86 X servers, you only need
           the X32servonly.tgz file which is the ``ServersOnly''
           cut-down source distribution.

    <item> The full XFree86 source tree requires about 130MB.  An additional
      130MB (more for OSs without shared libraries) is required to build
      everything.  About 55-65MB (for OSs with shared libraries) is required
      to install the full distribution.  It is possible to reduce the space
      required by removing some parts which are not essential to the build
      process:

<tscreen><verb>
 xc/test                      16MB
 xc/doc/hardcopy              11MB
 xc/doc/specs                 27MB
</verb></tscreen>

      If you don't need to build the fonts, <tt>xc/fonts</tt> can be
      removed saving 30MB.  If you don't want to build PEX or XIE you
      can remove:
<tscreen><verb>
 xc/programs/Xserver/XIE       3MB
 xc/programs/Xserver/PEX5      2MB
</verb></tscreen>

      A few more MB can be freed by removing the non-XFree86 directories under
 <tt>xc/programs/Xserver/hw/</tt>.

    <item> It is possible to configure a cut-down source tree for building only
      the XFree86 servers.  Building from a cut-down source tree requires
      about 50-55MB of disk space.

    <item> The <tt/contrib-3.2.diff.gz/ patch provides patches
    to a small part of the X Consortium's R6.1 contrib distribution.  It
    mostly covers those clients which were in the core distribution of
    X11R5 but were moved to the contrib distribution for X11R6.  To
    use this patch, you need to have the following files/directories
    from the final X Consortium R6.1 contrib release.

<tscreen><verb>
          contrib/Imakefile
          contrib/programs/Imakefile
          contrib/programs/ico
          contrib/programs/listres
          contrib/programs/showfont
          contrib/programs/viewres
          contrib/programs/xbiff
          contrib/programs/xcalc
          contrib/programs/xditview
          contrib/programs/xedit
          contrib/programs/xev
          contrib/programs/xeyes
          contrib/programs/xfontsel
          contrib/programs/xgc
          contrib/programs/xload
          contrib/programs/xman
          contrib/programs/xmessage
</verb></tscreen>
     </itemize>
        
<item> If you are starting from the stock X Consortium R6.1 PL01 source
   distribution, go to the
   directory above your <tt/xc/ directory, and run:

<tscreen><verb>
      gzip -d < R6.1pl1-3.2.diff.gz | patch -p -E
      gzip -d < cfont32.tgz | tar vxf -
</verb></tscreen>

   If you are installing in an unmodified tree there shouldn't be any
   problems.  Check for any patch rejections and resolve them. If
   you've modified some files (e.g. <tt/xf86site.def/, <tt/site.def/)
   you should rename them, and restore the standard versions before
   patching. If you don't have backups of the originals, individual
   files can be easily obtained from <htmlurl url="ftp://ftp.x.org/pub/R6.1/xc"
   name="ftp://ftp.x.org/pub/R6.1/xc">.

   If you are patching a tree that you've previously used, make sure you run
   ``<tt/make clean/'' from the <tt/xc/ directory before applying the diffs.

   If you are using the patch for the contrib code, go to the directory
   above your <tt/contrib/ directory, and run:

<tscreen><verb>
      gzip -d < contrib-3.2.diff.gz | patch -p -E
</verb></tscreen>

<!--
<item> If you are starting from the XFree86 3.1.1 source distribution,
   go to the directory above your <tt/xc/ directory, and run:

<tscreen><verb>
      gzip -d < 3.1.1-3.1.2.diff.gz | patch -p -E
      gzip -d < cfont312.tgz | tar vxf -
</verb></tscreen>

   If you are installing in an unmodified tree there shouldn't be any
   problems.  Check for any patch rejections and resolve them.  If
   you've modified some files (e.g. <tt/xf86site.def/, <tt/site.def/)
   you should rename them, and restore the standard versions before

   files for version 3.1.2 can be easily obtained from
   <url url="ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/pub/XFree86/3.1.2/untarred"
   name="ftp.xfree86.org:/pub/XFree86/3.1.2/untarred">.

</verb></tscreen>
-->

<item> Read through <tt>config/cf/xf86site.def</tt>.  Set the various
   parameters to suit your configuration.  If it is your first build,
   you should set <bf/BuildFonts/ to YES.

   If you are using a cut-down source tree for building only the X servers,
   set <bf/BuildServersOnly/ to <bf/YES/, and <bf/XnestServer/ to <bf/NO/.

   Set the defines to specify which server(s) you want to build:

<tscreen><verb>
 Colour SVGA server (XF86_SVGA):           XF86SVGAServer
 16 colour (S)VGA server (XF86_VGA16):     XF86VGA16Server
 ET4000/W32 accelerated server (XF86_W32): XF86W32Server
 Monochrome server  (XF86_Mono):           XF86MonoServer
 S3 accelerated server (XF86_S3):          XF86S3Server
 S3 ViRGE accelerated server (XF86_S3V):   XF86S3VServer
 8514/A accelerated server (XF86_8514):    XF86I8514Server
 Mach8 accelerated server (XF86_Mach8):    XF86Mach8Server
 Mach32 accelerated server (XF86_Mach32):  XF86Mach32Server
 Mach64 accelerated server (XF86_Mach64):  XF86Mach64Server
 P9000 accelerated server (XF86_P9000):    XF86P9000Server
 AGX accelerated server (XF86_AGX):        XF86AGXServer
 I128 server (XF86_I128):                  XF86I128Server
</verb></tscreen>
       
   To build a dual headed Mono+VGA2 server, set <bf/XF86MonoDualServer/ to
   <bf/YES/.

   To build a dual headed Mono+VGA16 server, set
   <bf/XF86VGA16DualServer/ to <bf/YES/.

   Set <bf/ServerToInstall/ to the server you want linked to <tt/X/.  If
   this isn't specified, it will default to the first one in the above
   list which is being built.
   
   The drivers you wish to include in the server are also selected in
   <tt/xf86site.def/.  The drivers used for the SVGA server are set by
   the <bf/XF86SvgaDrivers/ parameter.  This should be a list of the
   driver directory names (in lower case).  The ordering determines
   the order in which the drivers are probed at startup.  The default
   is to include all supplied drivers.  Similarly the following
   parameters specify drivers for the other servers:
<tscreen><verb>
 XF86Vga16Drivers            XF86_VGA16
 XF86Vga2Drivers             XF86_Mono (vga2 drivers)
 XF86MonoDrivers             XF86_Mono, XF86_VGA16 (other mono drivers)
</verb></tscreen>

   The SVGA, VGA16 and VGA2 screens each have ``generic'' drivers, and these
   should always be last in the list because their probe will succeed for
   any VGA card.

<item> If you want to be able to format the XFree86 documentation
   (which is now in LinuxDoc/SGML form), you will need to get and install
   linuxdoc-sgml-1.2.tar.gz plus the patches which can be found on
   <htmlurl name="ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/pub/XFree86/3.2/Linuxdoc"
    url="ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/pub/XFree86/3.2/Linuxdoc">.  Check
   in the <tt/xf86site.def/ file and uncomment the appropriate Linuxdoc
   options.
   
<item> Before building the distribution, read through the OS-specific
   <tt/README/ file in <tt>xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/doc</tt> that is
   relevant to you.  Once those OS-specific details have been taken
   care of, go the <tt/xc/ directory and run ``<tt/make World/'' with the
   <bf/BOOTSTRAPCFLAGS/ set as described in the OS-specific README.  It
   is advisable to redirect stdout and stderr to <tt/World.Log/ so that you
   can track down problems that might occur during the build.
   If you are using one of the cut-down source distributions, you should
   run ``<tt/make -f Makefile.ini World/'' because they will usually not
   include the top level Makefile.

<item> If all goes well, that will finish successfully in anything
   from two to twelve hours depending on your system.
   You should check <tt/World.Log/ to see
   if there were any problems.  If there weren't any then you can install
   the binaries.  When using the full source distribution, the installation
   should be done from the <tt/xc/ directory.  When using the ServersOnly
   distribution, the install should be done from the
   <tt>xc/programs/Xserver</tt> directory
   To do
   the install, run ``<tt/make
   install/'' and ``<tt/make install.man/''.  Make sure you have enough
   space in <tt>/usr/X11R6</tt> for the install to succeed.  If you want
   to install on a filesystem other than <tt>/usr</tt>, make a symbolic
   link to <tt>/usr/X11R6</tt> before installing.

   To install the binary LinkKit (in <tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/Server</tt>),
   run the following from the <tt/xc/ directory (when using either the
   full source distribution or the ServersOnly distribution):
<tscreen><verb>
     make install.linkkit
</verb></tscreen>

<item> To build the subset of the contrib release supported by
   XFree86, make sure that you have first built and installed the core
   distribution.  Then go to the <tt/contrib/ directory and run
   ``<tt/xmkmf -a; make/''.  When that is completed, run
   ``<tt/make install/'' and ``<tt/make install.man/'' to install it.
</enum>

<!--
<sect> Using and Configuring XFree86
<p>
<enum>
<item> Add <tt>/usr/X11R6/bin</tt> to your <bf/PATH/ and
   <tt>/usr/X11R6/man</tt> to your <bf/MANPATH/.

<item> Set up an <tt/XF86Config/ file.  The default locations for this
   file are: <tt>/etc/XF86Config</tt>,
   <tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config.</tt><em/hostname/, and
   <tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config</tt>.  The recommended way to generate
   an <tt/XF86Config/ file is to use the <tt/xf86config/ utility.  Also,
   there is a sample file
   installed as <tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config.eg</tt>, which
   can be used as a starting point.

   For details about the <tt/XF86Config/ file format, refer to the
   <em>XF86Config(4/5)</em> manual page.
   
<item> If you use a <tt>&dollar;{HOME}/.xserverrc</tt> file with xinit, make
   sure that the script exec's the server (e.g ``<tt>exec
   /usr/X11R6/bin/XF86_SVGA</tt>'' rather than just
   ``<tt>/usr/X11R6/bin/XF86_SVGA</tt>'').  If you don't do this, the
   server may be slow to start, and may not exit when your last client finishes.
</enum>
-->

<sect> Reconfiguring the server (source distribution)
<p>
To build a different set of servers or servers with a different set of
drivers installed:
<enum>
<item>Make sure the source for any new drivers is in the correct place (e.g.,
   driver source for the SVGA server should be in a subdirectory of
   <tt>xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/vga256/drivers</tt>).

<item> Change the settings of the server defines (eg <bf/XF86SVGAServer/ as
   described above) in <tt/xf86site.def/ to specify which servers you
   wish to build.  Also, change the driver lists to suit your needs.

<item> From <tt>xc/programs/Xserver</tt>, run:
<tscreen><verb>
     make Makefile
     make Makefiles
     make depend
     make
</verb></tscreen>
</enum>

<sect> Reconfiguring the server (binary distribution)
<p>
  If you have installed the server Binary LinkKit, it is possible to
reconfigure the drivers and some of the extensions in the servers.  For
details of how to do this, please refer to the <htmlurl url="LinkKit.html"
name="README.LinkKit"> file.
