<sect>Supported hardware
<p>
The current accelerated I128 server supports
<p>
<itemize>
<item>Imagine 128
(I128 with Texas Instruments TVP3025 or IBM528 RAMDAC). It has been tested with 
with 4MB of VRAM. 
<item>Imagine 128 Ticket 2 Ride
(I128-T2R with IBM526 or 528 RAMDAC). It has been tested with 4 MB and 8 MB of
VRAM and DRAM.
<item>Imagine 128 Revolution 3D
(I128-R3D with IBM526 RAMDAC).  It has been tested with 4 MB, 8 MB, and 16 MB
of WRAM or SGRAM.
<item>Imagine 128 Revolution IV
(I128-R4 with SILVERHAMMER RAMDAC).  It has been tested with 32 MB.
</itemize>

<sect>Features:
<p>
<itemize>
<item>uses linear frame buffer
<item>Resolutions up to the maximum supported by the card should be possible.
<item>8 bpp, 16 bpp (depth 15 and 16), and 32 bpp (depth 24, sparse) are
supported.
<item>supports RGB Sync-on-Green 
<item>Makes use of the graphics accelerator.
</itemize>

<sect>Configuration:
<p>
The I128 driver should auto-detect all supported hardware so you needn't 
have anything other than the Identifier in the Section "Device" of the
XF86Config file.  When running the XF86Setup or xf86config programs one    
merely needs to select an I128 card so that the correct server will be  
used.  One need not and should not specify a RAMDAC, clockchip or allow 
the setup program to probe for clocks. The driver will auto-detect the   
amount of video ram present.

The following Section "Device" options are supported by the MGA driver:
<itemize>
<item>Option "dac_8_bit"
<p>
Will enable 8-bit DAC support.
<item>Option "no_accel"
<p>
Will disable all hardware acceleration.
<item>Option "sync_on_green"
<p>
Will enable syncing on green for sync-on-green monitors (these are typically
fixed frequency workstation monitors).
</itemize>

<sect>Mode lines for the SiliconGraphics flat panel display:

SiliconGraphics Flat Panel display.
