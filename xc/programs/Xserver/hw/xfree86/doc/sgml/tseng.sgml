<sect> Supported chipsets <p>
The Tseng chipsets supported by XFree86 are ET3000, ET4000, ET4000/W32 and
ET6000. At this time, the accelerated features of the ET4000/W32 and ET6000
are not supported by the SVGA driver; the chipset is treated as a standard
ET4000. For details about the accelerated ET4000/W32 and ET6000 server, refer to
<url name="README.W32" url="W32.html">.


<sect> ET4000 driver features <p>

The SVGA driver for ET4000 chipsets only supports 8bpp mode (256 colors).
hi- and truecolor modes are not supported.


<sect> ET6000 driver features <p>
In addition to the features in the ET4000 driver, the SVGA ET6000 server
supports all possible color depths in the SVGA server: 8bpp, 16bpp (both at
5-5-5 and 5-6-5 color resolutions), 24bpp and 32 bpp.

Linear memory mode (as opposed to the default, banked memory layout) is
supported. It is even required for 16/24/32 bpp modes. Put the following in
the SVGA section of your
<tt>XF86Config</tt>:
<verb>
  Option "linear"
</verb>


<sect> Clock selection problems with some ET4000 boards <p>
XFree86 has some problems getting the clock selection right with some
ET4000 boards when the server is started from a high-resolution text mode.
The clock selection is always correct when the server is started from a
standard 80x25 text mode.

This problem is indicated when the reported clocks are different when the
server is started from the high-resolution text mode from what they are
when it is started from the 80x25 text mode.  To allow the server to work
correctly from the high-resolution text mode, there are some Option flags
that may be set in <tt>XF86Config</tt>.
To find out which flags to set, start the
server with the -probeonly flag from an 80x25 text mode and look at the
information printed by the server.  If the line:
<verb>
  VGAXXX: ET4000: Initial hibit state: low
</verb>
is printed, put the following in the SVGA, VGA16 and VGA2 sections of your
<tt>XF86Config</tt>:
<verb>
  Option "hibit_low"
</verb>
If the line:
<verb>
  VGAXXX: ET4000: Initial hibit state: high
</verb>
is printed, put the following in the SVGA, VGA16 and VGA2 sections of your
<tt>XF86Config</tt>:
<verb>
  Option "hibit_high"
</verb>

<sect> Text mode restore problems <p>
In XFree86 1.3, an option flag ``force_bits'' was provided as an experiment
to attempt to alleviate text-restoration problems that some people experienced.
We have now made the behavior of this option the default, hence the flag
has been removed.  Hopefully the past text-restoration problems are alleviated 
in XFree86 2.0.
